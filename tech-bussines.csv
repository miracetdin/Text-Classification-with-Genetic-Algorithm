0, The Kyrgyz Republic a small mountainous state of the former Soviet republic is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country's elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting.  This new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population. In an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as ""an island of democracy"" the Kyrgyz President Askar Akaev pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming Parliamentary and Presidential elections. The US government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision.  The Kyrgyz Republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid-1990s with a hastily pushed through referendum in 2003 reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with 75 deputies. The use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections - the German Embassy the Soros Foundation and the Kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes.  The actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated. The ink is sprayed on a person's left thumb. It dries and is not visible under normal light.  However the presence of ultraviolet light (of the kind used to verify money) causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light. At the entrance to each polling station one election official will scan voter's fingers with UV lamp before allowing them to enter and every voter will have his/her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot. If the ink shows under the UV light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station. Likewise any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot. These elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors - the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the Autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former Soviet Republics notably Ukraine and Georgia. The use of ink has been controversial - especially among groups perceived to be pro-government.  Widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep - a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society.  The author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink. The greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance. Local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems. Others such as the aggressively middle of the road Coalition of Non-governmental Organizations have lauded the move as an important step forward. This type of ink has been used in many elections in the world in countries as varied as Serbia South Africa Indonesia and Turkey. The other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink - but as the elections in Afghanistan showed improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems. The use of ""invisible"" ink is not without its own problems. In most elections numerous rumors have spread about it.  In Serbia for example both Christian and Islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion. Other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink - various soft drinks solvents and cleaning products are put forward. However in reality the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off. The ink stays on the finger for at least 72 hours and for up to a week. The use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills. The passage of the inking law is nevertheless a clear step forward towards free and fair elections."" The country's widely watched parliamentary elections are scheduled for 27 February.

0, Chinese authorities closed 12575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004 the country's government said.  According to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally. Chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools. The move is the latest in a series of steps the Chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use.  The official Xinhua News Agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a ""safer environment for young people in China"". Rules introduced in 2002 demand that net cafes be at least 200 metres away from middle and elementary schools. The hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated. China has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people. The 12575 cafes were shut in the three months from October to December. China also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to.  Net cafes are hugely popular in China because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have PCs in their homes. This is not the first time that the Chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines. All the 100000 or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see. Logs of sites people visit are also kept. Laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people. During the crackdown following the blaze authorities moved to clean up net cafes and demanded that all of them get permits to operate. In August 2004 Chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn. At the same time it introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites. The Reporters Without Borders group said in a report that Chinese government technologies for e-mail interception and net censorship are among the most highly developed in the world. ";;;
0, Microsoft is investigating a trojan program that attempts to switch off the firm's anti-spyware software.  The spyware tool was only released by Microsoft in the last few weeks and has been downloaded by six million people. Stephen Toulouse a security manager at Microsoft said the malicious program was called Bankash-A Trojan and was being sent as an e-mail attachment. Microsoft said it did not believe the program was widespread and recommended users to use an anti-virus program. The program attempts to disable or delete Microsoft's anti-spyware tool and suppress warning messages given to users.  It may also try to steal online banking passwords or other personal information by tracking users' keystrokes.  Microsoft said in a statement it is investigating what it called a criminal attack on its software. Earlier this week Microsoft said it would buy anti-virus software maker Sybari Software to improve its security in its Windows and e-mail software. Microsoft has said it plans to offer its own paid-for anti-virus software but it has not yet set a date for its release. The anti-spyware program being targeted is currently only in beta form and aims to help users find and remove spyware - programs which monitor internet use causes advert pop-ups and slow a PC's performance.

0, Nicholas Negroponte chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (Â£53).  He told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be "" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood"". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a Linux-based operating system ""We have to get the display down to below $20 to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.  ""The second trick is to get rid of the fat  if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory."" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.  While the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. ""We put in 25 laptops three years ago  only one has been broken the kids cherish these things it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine not just a textbook."" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. ""Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years we're talking about months."" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. ""In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That's for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away."" ";;;
0, The hi-tech and the arts worlds have for some time danced around each other and offered creative and technical help when required.  Often this help has come in the form of corporate art sponsorship or infrastructure provision. But that dance is growing more intimate as hi-tech firms look to the creative industries for inspiration. And vice versa. UK telco BT is serious about the idea and has launched its Connected World initiative. The idea says BT is to shape a ""21st Century model"" which will help cement the art technology and business worlds together. ""We are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology"" said Frank Stone head of the BT's business sector programmes. He looks after several ""centres of excellence"" which the telco has set up with other institutions and organisations one of which is focused on creative industries.  To mark the initiative's launch a major international art installation is to open on 15 April in Brussels with a further exhibit in Madrid later in the summer. They have both been created using the telco's technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm including a sophisticated graphics rendering program. Using a 3D graphics engine the type commonly used in gaming Bafta-winning artists Langlands & Bell have created a virtual story-based 3D model of Brussels' Coudenberg Cellars.  They have recently been excavated and are thought to be the remnants of Coudenberg Palace an historical seat of European power. The 3D world can be navigated using a joystick and offers an immersive experience of a landscape that historically had a river running through it until it was bricked up in the 19th Century. ""The river was integral to the city's survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared"" said the artists. ""We hope that by uncovering the river we can greater understand the connections between the past and the present and appreciate the flow of modernity once concealing but now revealing the River Senne."" In their previous works they used the Quake game graphics engine. The game engine is the core component of a video game because it handles graphics rendering game AI and how objects behave and relate to each other in a game. They are so time-consuming and expensive to create the engines can be licensed out to handle other graphics-intensive games. BT's own engine Tara (Total Abstract Rendering Architecture) has been in development since 2001 and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners. It was also used in 2003 in Encounter an urban-based pervasive game that combined both virtual play in conjunction with physical on-the-street action. Because the artists wanted video and interactive elements in their worlds new features were added to Tara in order to handle the complex data sets. But collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new and many keen coders designers games makers and animators argue that what they create is art itself.  As more tools for self-expression are given to the person on the street enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload them to the web for instance creativity will become an integral part of technology. The Orange Expressionist exhibition last year for example displayed thousands of picture messages from people all over the UK to create an interactive installation.  Technology as a way of unleashing creativity has massive potential not least because it gives people something to do with their technology. Big businesses know it is good for them to get in on the creative vein too. The art world is ""fantastically rich"" said Mr Stone with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like BT want to get in with them. Between 1997 and 2002 the creative industry brought Â£21 billion to London alone. It is an industry that is growing by 6% a year too. The partnership between artists and technologists is part of trying to understand the creative potential of technologies like broadband net according to Mr Stone. ""This is not just about putting art galleries and museums online"" he said. ""It is about how can everyone have the best seat in house and asking if technology has a role in solving that problem."" With broadband penetration reaching 100% in the UK businesses with a stake in the technology want to give people reasons to want and use it. The creative drive is not purely altruistic obviously. It is about both industries borrowing strategies and creative ideas together which can result in better business practices for creative industries or more patent ideas for tech companies. ""What we are trying to do is have outside-in thinking. ""We are creating a future cultural drive for the economy"" said Mr Stone. ";;;
0, A network of community computer centres linked by wireless technology is providing a helping hand for poor farmers in Peru.  The pilot scheme in the Huaral Valley 80 kilometres north of the capital Lima aims to offer the 6000-strong community up-to-date information on agricultural market prices and trends. The Agricultural Information Project for Farmers of the Chancay-Huaral Valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation enabling them to coordinate their actions. More than 13000 rural inhabitants as well as 18000 students in the region will also benefit from the telecoms infrastructure.  The 14 telecentres uses only free open source software and affordable computer equipment. The network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in September.  The non-government organisation Cepes (Peruvian Centre for Social Studies) led the $200000 project also backed by local institutions the Education and Agriculture ministries and European development organisations. ""The plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system"" said Carlos Saldarriaga technical coordinator at Cepes. Farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land. The Board of Irrigation Users which runs the computer centres aims to make the network self-sustainable within three years through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes.  One of the key elements of the project is the Agricultural Information System with its flagship huaral.org website. There farmers can find the prices for local produce as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques. The system also helps the inhabitants of the Chancay-Huaral Valley to organise their vital irrigation systems. ""Water is the main element that unites them all. It is a precious element in Peru's coastal areas because it is so scarce and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it"" Mr Saldarriaga told the BBC News website. The information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of Peru and even around the world.  Cepes says the involvement of the farmers has been key in the project's success. ""Throughout the last three years the people have provided a vital thrust to the project";" they feel it belongs to them"" said Mr Saldarriaga. The community training sessions attended by an equal number of men and women have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm. ""We have had an excellent response mainly from young people. But we have also had a great feedback when we trained 40 or 50-year old women who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives."" So far the Huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers' organisations in Peru. ""This is a pilot project and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places"" underlined Mr Saldarriaga.  The Cepes researcher recalls what happened in Cuyo a 50-family community with no electricity during the construction of the local telecentre site. There it was necessary to build a mini-hydraulic dam in order to generate 2kW worth of power for the computers the communications equipment and the cabin lights. ""It was already dark when the technicians realised they didn't have any light bulbs to test the generator so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs"" recalls Carlos Saldarriaga. ""The logical answer was 'we don't sell any' so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing."" Now with the wireless network Cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated.

0, Microsoft has warned PC users to update their systems with the latest security fixes for flaws in Windows programs.  In its monthly security bulletin it flagged up eight ""critical"" security holes which could leave PCs open to attack if left unpatched. The number of holes considered ""critical"" is more than usual. They affect Windows programs including Internet Explorer (IE) media player and instant messaging. Four other important fixes were also released. These were considered to be less critical however. If not updated either automatically or manually PC users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes. Many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely install programs change and delete or see data.  One of the critical patches Microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some IE flaws. Stephen Toulouse a Microsoft security manager said the flaws were known about and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw he did not rule them out. Often when a critical flaw is announced spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched. A further patch fixes a hole in Media Player Windows Messenger and MSN Messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. Microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in its software every month. The most important ones are those which are classed as ""critical"". Its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker Sybari Software as part of Microsoft's plans to make its own security programs. ";;;
0, Security firms are warning about a Windows virus disguising itself as an electronic Christmas card.  The Zafi.D virus translates the Christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail. Anti-virus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online. Anti-virus firm Sophos said that 10% of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the Zafi virus.  Like many other Windows viruses Zafi-D plunders Microsoft Outlook for e-mail addresses and then uses mail-sending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims. To be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug. The attachment on the e-mail poses as an electronic Christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces.  The virus' subject line says ""Merry Christmas"" and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to. The message in the body of the e-mail reads: ""Happy Holidays"" and this too is translated. On infected machines the virus tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the PC to hand over control to the writer of the virus. The virus is thought to have spread most widely in South America Italy Spain Bulgaria and Hungary. The original Zafi virus appeared in April this year. ""We have seen these hoaxes for several Christmases already and personally I prefer traditional pen and paper cards and we recommend this to all our clients too"" said Mikko Hypponen who heads F-Secure's anti-virus team.

0, The Apple Powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time by US magazine Mobile PC.  The 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first ""lightweight"" portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook PCs. The magazine has compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two. Gadgets needed moving parts and/or electronics to warrant inclusion. The magazine specified that gadgets also needed to be a ""self-contained apparatus that can be used on its own not a subset of another device"".  ""In general we included only items that were potentially mobile"" said the magazine.  ""In the end we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget"" it concluded. The oldest ""gadget"" in the top 100 is the abacus which the magazine dates at 190 A.D. and put in 60th place. Other pre-electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 (59th position) the marine chronometer from 1761 (42nd position) and the Kodak Brownie camera from 1900 (28th position). The Tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10 which also includes the first flash mp3 player (Diamound Multimedia) as well as the first ""successful"" digital camera (Casio QV-10) and mobile phone (Motorola Startac). The most popular gadget of the moment the Apple iPod is at number 12 in the list while the first Sony transistor radio is at number 13.  Sony's third entry in the top 20 is the CDP-101 CD player from 1983. ""Who can forget the crystalline hiss-free blast of Madonna's Like A Virgin emenating from their first CD player?"" asked the magazine. Karl Elsener's knife the Swiss Army Knife from 1891 is at number 20 in the list. Gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in the list include the original telephone (23rd) the Nintendo GameBoy (25th) and the Pulsar quartz digital watch (36th). The list also contains plenty of oddities: the Pez sweet dispenser (98th) 1980s toy Tamagotchi (86th) and the bizarre Ronco inside the shell egg scrambler (84th).  Why worry about mobile phones. Soon they will be subsumed into the PDA's / laptops etc.  What about the Marine Chronometer? Completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries. For it's time a technological marvel!  Sony Net Minidisc! It paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market. I always used my NetMD and could not go anywhere without it.  A laptop computer is not a gadget! It's a working tool!  The Sinclair Executive was the world's first pocket calculator. I think this should be there as well.  How about the clockwork radio? Or GPS? Or a pocket calculator? All these things are useful to real people not just PC magazine editors.  Are the people who created this list insane ? Surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone? It has revolutionalised communication which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. From outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly.  Has everyone forgot about the Breville pie maker??  An interesting list. Of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc - the Tandy 100. The size of A4 paper and light three weeks on a set of batteries an excellent keyboard a modem. A pity Tandy did not make it DOS compatible.  What's an Apple Powerbook 100 ? It's out of date - not much of a ""gadget"". Surely it has to be something simple / timeless - the tin opener Swiss Army Knife safety razor blade wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves ?  It has to be the mobile phone. No other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time.  The ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever. Also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule.  The Casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980. A true gadget it could be carried around and shown off.  All top 10 are electronic toys so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anyhting else. I say this as the Swiss Army Knife only made No 20.  Sinclair QL a machine far ahead of its time. The first home machine with a true multi-takings OS. Shame the marketing was so bad!!!  Apple.. a triumph of fashion over... well everything else.  Utter rubbish. Yes the Apple laptop and Sony Walkman are classic gadgets. But to call the sextant and the marine chronometer 'gadgets' and rank them as less important than a TV remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. The former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. The latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed. No competition.  I'd also put Apple's Newton and the first Palm Pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the Toshiba Libretto for the same reason. I only wish that Vulcan Inc's Flipstart wasn't just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top.  How did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise)? What about radios and TVs?  The swiss army knife. By far the most useful gadget. I got mine 12 years ago. Still wearing and using it a lot! It stood the test of time.  Psion Organiser series 3 should be up there. Had a usable qwerty keyboard removable storage good set of apps and programmable. Case design was good (batteries in the hinge - a first I think). Great product innovation.  The first mobile PC was voted best gadget by readers of...err... mobile PC?! Why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site? It's obviously the mobile phone or remote control and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that.  The Motorola Startac should be Number One. Why? There will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices.  The Psion series 3c! The first most practical way to carry all your info around...  I too would back the Sinclair Spectrum - without this little beauty I would never have moved into the world of IT and earn the living that I do now.  I'd have put the mobile phone high up the list. Probably a Nokia model.  Sinclair Spectrum - 16k. It plugged into the tv. Games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that's what I do for a living now.  I wish more modern notebooks -- even Apple's newest offerings -- were more like the PB100. Particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball which has given way to the largely useless ""trackpad"" which every notebook on the market today uses. They're invariably inaccurate uncomfortable and cumbersome to use.  Congratulations to Apple a deserved win! ";;;
0, Search engine firm Google has released a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites.  The AutoLink feature comes with Google's latest toolbar and provides links in a webpage to Amazon.com if it finds a book's ISBN number on the site. It also links to Google's map service if there is an address or to car firm Carfax if there is a licence plate. Google said the feature available only in the US ""adds useful links"". But some users are concerned that Google's dominant position in the search engine market place could mean it would be giving a competitive edge to firms like Amazon.  AutoLink works by creating a link to a website based on information contained in a webpage - even if there is no link specified and whether or not the publisher of the page has given permission.  If a user clicks the AutoLink feature in the Google toolbar then a webpage with a book's unique ISBN number would link directly to Amazon's website. It could mean online libraries that list ISBN book numbers find they are directing users to Amazon.com whether they like it or not. Websites which have paid for advertising on their pages may also be directing people to rival services. Dan Gillmor founder of Grassroots Media which supports citizen-based media said the tool was a ""bad idea and an unfortunate move by a company that is looking to continue its hypergrowth"". In a statement Google said the feature was still only in beta ie trial stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users. It said: ""The user can choose never to click on the AutoLink button and web pages she views will never be modified. ""In addition the user can choose to disable the AutoLink feature entirely at any time.""  The new tool has been compared to the Smart Tags feature from Microsoft by some users. It was widely criticised by net users and later dropped by Microsoft after concerns over trademark use were raised. Smart Tags allowed Microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by the company. Google said none of the companies which received AutoLinks had paid for the service. Some users said AutoLink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any ""click through"" to a commercial site. Cory Doctorow European outreach coordinator for digital civil liberties group Electronic Fronter Foundation said that Google should not be penalised for its market dominance. ""Of course Google should be allowed to direct people to whatever proxies it chooses. ""But as an end user I would want to know - 'Can I choose to use this service? 'How much is Google being paid?' 'Can I substitute my own companies for the ones chosen by Google?'."" Mr Doctorow said the only objection would be if users were forced into using AutoLink or ""tricked into using the service"". ";;;
0, British TV viewers lead the trend of illegally downloading US shows from the net according to research.  New episodes of 24 Desperate Housewives and Six Feet Under appear on the web hours after they are shown in the US said a report. Web tracking company Envisional said 18% of downloaders were from within the UK and that downloads of TV programmes had increased by 150% in the last year. About 70% were using file-sharing program BitTorrent the firm said. ""It's now as easy to download a pirate TV show as it is to programme a VCR"" said Ben Coppin from Envisional. A typical episode of 24 was downloaded by about 100000 people globally said the report and an estimated 20000 of those were from within the UK.  Fans of many popular US TV programmes like 24 usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in the UK. But in some cases said the report people were able to watch the new episodes in Britain before US audiences on the west coast of the country. ""Missing a television show presents little problem to anyone with a basic knowledge of the internet"" explained Mr Coppin.  ""Two clicks and your favourite programme is downloading. In effect the internet is now a global video recorder."" Exact figures are difficult to pin down but it is thought that about 80000 to 100000 people in the UK download TV programmes. Some may just want the odd episode others are downloading regularly. Many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content like TV programmes. This presents a challenge to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people. It is also of concern to them because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes. The industry has coined the term ""time-shifting"" to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want when you want. The increased popularity of personal digital video recorders TiVo-type boxes which automatically record programmes like Sky+ have also contributed to the trend. There are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store TV programmes for viewers effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer.  Within half an hour recorded episodes can be uploaded - or posted - onto file-sharing networks or other download sites. Because they tend to be shorter then full-length films they can be processed - digitised - quickly. More people with high-speed broadband connections in the UK also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly.  According to Jupiter Research 40% of homes with broadband say it helps them pick and choose the programmes they want to see or that friends have recommended. The Envisional reports said that the TV industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows. The BBC ran a trial of what it calls the Interactive Media Player (iMP) last year which was based on a peer-to-peer distribution model. It let people download programmes it held the rights to up to eight days after they had already aired. It is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year. The BBC already allows radio fans to hear programmes they missed online up to a week after broadcast. About six million people in the UK now have a fast always-on net connection via cable or phone lines. ";;;
0, IBM is spending $100m (Â£52m) over the next three years beefing up its commitment to Linux software.  The cash injection will be used to help its customers use Linux on every type of device from handheld computers and phones right up to powerful servers. IBM said the money will fund a variety of technical research and marketing initiatives to boost Linux use. IBM said it had taken the step in response to greater customer demand for the open source software.  In 2004 IBM said it had seen double digit growth in the number of customers using Linux to help staff work together more closely. The money will be used to help this push towards greater collaboration and will add Linux-based elements to IBM's Workplace software. Workplace is a suite of programs and tools that allow workers to get at core business applications no matter what device they use to connect to corporate networks. One of the main focuses of the initiative will be to make it easier to use Linux-based desktop computers and mobile devices with Workplace. Even before IBM announced this latest spending boost it was one of the biggest advocates of the open source way of working. In 2001 it put $300m into a three-year Linux program and has produced Linux versions of many of its programs. Linux and the open source software movement are based on the premise that developers should be free to tinker with the core components of software programs.

The UK Film Council has awarded a contract worth Â£11.5m to Arts Alliance Digital Cinema (AADC) who will set up the network of up to 250 screens. AADC will oversee the selection of cinemas across the UK which will use the digital equipment. High definition projectors and computer servers will be installed to show mainly British and specialist films. Most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to 250 screens in up to 150 cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images. The new network will double the world's total of digital screens. Cinemas will be given the film on a portable hard drive and they will then copy the content to a computer server.  Each film is about 100 gigabytes and has been compressed from an original one terabyte-size file. Fiona Deans associate director of AADC said the compression was visually lossless so no picture degradation will occur.  The film will all be encrypted to prevent piracy and each cinema will have an individual key which will unlock the movie. ""People will see the picture quality is a bit clearer with no scratches. ""The picture will look exactly the same as when the print was first made - there is no degradation in quality over time.""  The key benefit of the digital network will be an increase in the distribution and screening of British films documentaries and foreign language films.  ""Access to specialised film is currently restricted across the UK"" said Pete Buckingham head of Distribution and Exhibition at the UK Film Council. ""Although a genuine variety of films is available in central London and a few other metropolitan areas the choice for many outside these areas remains limited and the Digital Screen Network will improve access for audiences across the UK"" Digital prints costs less than a traditional 35mm print - giving distributors more flexibility in how they screen films said Ms Deans. ""It can cost up to Â£1500 to make a copy of a print for specialist films. ""In the digital world you can make prints for considerably less than that. ""Distributors can then send out prints to more cinemas and prints can stay in cinemas for much longer."" The UK digital network will be the first to employ 2k projectors - which are capable of showing films at resolutions of 2048 * 1080 pixels. A separate competitive process to determine which cinemas will receive the digital screening technology will conclude in May. The sheer cost of traditional prints means that some cinemas need to show them twice a day in order to recoup costs. ""Some films need word of mouth and time to build momentum - they don't need to be shown twice a day"" explained Ms Deans. ""A cinema will often book a 35mm print in for two weeks - even if the film is a roaring success they cannot hold on to the print because it will have to go to another cinema. ""With digital prints every cinema will have its own copy."" ";;;
0, The European Parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.  Politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law. During consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped. The bill was backed by some hi-tech firms saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile.  Hugo Lueders European director for public policy at CompTIA an umbrella organization for technology companies said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would European inventors prosper. He said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. Other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the American system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software. But opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement. The proposed law had a troubled passage through the European parliament. Its progress was delayed twice when Polish MEPs rejected plans to adopt it. Also earlier this month the influential European Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of MEPs. To become law both the European Parliament and a qualified majority of EU states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill. The latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the EU for re-consideration. ";;;
0, Microsoft has said it will replace more than 14 million power cables for its Xbox consoles due to safety concerns.  The company said the move was a ""preventative step"" after reports of fire hazard problems with the cables. It affects Xboxes made before 23 October 2003 for all regions but mainland Europe - and consoles in that region made before 13 January 2004. Microsoft said it had received 30 reports of minor injury or property damage due to faulty cables. The firm said fewer than one in 10000 consoles had experienced component failures. The recall affects almost three quarters of all Xboxes sold around the world since its launch in 2001.  In a statement it added: ""In almost all instances any damage caused by these failures was contained within the console itself or limited to the tip of the power cord at the back of the console."" But in seven cases customers reported sustaining a minor burn to their hand. In 23 cases customers reported smoke damage or minor damage to a carpet or entertainment centre. ""This is a preventative step we're choosing to take despite the rarity of these incidents"" said Robbie Bach senior vice president Microsoft home and entertainment division. ""We regret the inconvenience but believe offering consumers a free replacement cord is the responsible thing to do."" Consumers can order a new cable from the Xbox website or by telephoning 0800 028 9276 in the UK. Microsoft said customers would get replacement cords within two to four weeks from the time of order. It advised users to turn off their Xboxes when not in use. A follow-up to Xbox is expected to released at the end of this year or the beginning of 2006. ";;;
0, The global web blog community is being called into action to lend support to two imprisoned Iranian bloggers.  The month-old Committee to Protect Bloggers' is asking those with blogs to dedicate their sites on 22 February to the ""Free Mojtaba and Arash Day"". Arash Sigarchi and Mojtaba Saminejad are both in prison in Iran. Blogs are free sites through which people publish thoughts and opinions. Iranian authorities have been clamping down on prominent sites for some time. ""I hope this day will focus people"" Curt Hopkins director of the Committee told the BBC News website.  The group has a list of actions which it says bloggers can take including writing to local Iranian embassies. The Committee has deemed Tuesday ""Free Mojtaba and Arash Day"" as part of its first campaign. It is calling on the blogsphere - the name for the worldwide community of bloggers - to do what it can to help raise awareness of the plight of Mojtaba and Arash as well as other ""cyber-dissidents"". ""If you have a blog the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except 'Free Mojtaba and Arash Day'"" said Mr Hopkins. ""That would mean you could see that phrase 7.1 million times. That alone will shine some light on the situation. ""If you don't have one find one dedicated to that - it takes about 30 seconds."" Technorati a blog search engine tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12000 are added daily. A blog is created every 5.8 seconds according to a US research think-tank.  The Committee to Protect Bloggers was started by US blogger Curt Hopkins and counts fired flight attendant blogger Ellen Simonetti as a deputy director. She has since started the International Bloggers' Bill of Rights a global petition to protect bloggers at work. Although not the only website committed to human rights issues by any means it aims to be the hub or organisation information and support for bloggers in particular and their rights to freedom of speech.  The Committee although only a month old aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future and will operate as a non-for-profit organisation. ""Blogging is in this weird no man's land. People think of it as being one thing or another depending on their point of view"" said Mr Hopkins. ""Some think of themselves as pundits kind of like journalists and some like me have a private blog which is just a publishing platform. ""But they do not have a constituency and are out there in the cold.""  It is not just human rights issues in countries which have a track record of restricting what is published in the media that is of concern to bloggers. The question of bloggers and what rights they have to say what they want on their sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently. High profile cases in which employees have been sacked for what they have said on their personal and often anonymous blogs have highlighted the muddy situation that the blogsphere is currently in.  ""This is a big messy argument"" explained Mr Hopkins. He added: ""It is just such a new way of doing business there will be clamp downs."" But the way these issues get tested is through the courts which said Mr Hopkins ""is part of the whole messy conversation."" ""If you haven't already got bloggers in your company you will have them tomorrow - and if you don't have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one. Mr Hopkins said that the blogsphere - which is doubling every five months - was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog. ""Everyone does this - mums radicals conservatives"" he said. Many companies offer easy-to-use services to create a blog and publish it in minutes to a global community. ""That is the essential difference. What I call 'templating software' gives every single person on Earth the chance to have one. ""You don't even have to have your own computer."" ";;;
0, Re-using old mobile phones is not just good for the environment it has social benefits too.  Research has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide. The Forum for the Future research found that the low cost of these recycled handsets means they can have a very useful second life in poorer nations. But the Forum found that more needed to be done to collect old phones rather than let them rot in landfill sites.  The report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the UK. Of the 15 million that are swapped for newer models each year only 25% get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or re-use. The slowly growing mass of unrecycled discarded phones has now reached 90 million handsets the equivalent of 9000 tonnes of waste estimates James Goodman report author and a senior adviser at the Forum for the Future. ""It's quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around"" said Mr Goodman.  Many of these older phones could end up in landfill sites leaking the potentially toxic materials they are made of into the wider world said Mr Goodman. Far better he said to hand the phone back to an operator who can send it overseas where it can enjoy a second lease of life. ""We've heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back"" said Mr Goodman ""but there's a strong social argument too."" Older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model. The Forum for the Future report took an in-depth look at Romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular. ""It's an interesting country because it has a really crap fixed line network"" said Mr Goodman ""and there's a real desire for people to get mobile phones."" But the relatively low wages in Romania which is one of the poorest countries in Europe mean few people can afford a shiny new phone. ""The affordability of the handsets is a real barrier to getting one"" he said. Reconditioned handsets have boosted take-up of mobiles as the report revealed that almost one-third of Romanian pre-pay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets. The re-used handsets tend to be about one-third of the price of a new handset. Georgeta Minciu a Romanian part-time cleaner said: ""Normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages. I am a single parent - keeping in touch with my daughter is important to me."" ""This is the only way I can afford to have a phone"" she said. Mr Goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of Britain's mobile mountain made it overseas. But he added those keen to use a mobile will not accept any old handset. ""If its more than a few years old people are not going to want it"" he said. ";;;
0, Details of the chip designed to power Sony's PlayStation 3 console will be released in San Francisco on Monday.  Sony IBM and Toshiba who have been working on the Cell processor for three years will unveil the chip at a technology conference. The chip is reported to be up to 10 times faster than current processors. It is being designed for use in graphics workstations the new PlayStation console and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip. Sony has said the Cell processor could be used to bridge the gap between movies and video games. Special effects and graphics designed for films could be ported for use directly in a video game Sony told an audience at the E3 exhibition in Los Angeles last year.  Cell could also be marketed as an ideal technology for televisions and supercomputers and everything in between said Kevin Krewell the editor in chief of Microprocessor Report. The chip will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together. The PlayStation 3 is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch. Details of the chip will be released at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco. Some details have already emerged however. When put inside powerful computer servers the Cell consortium expects it to be capable of handling 16 trillion floating point operations or calculations every second.  The chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media. IBM said it would start producing the chip in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the US. The first machines off the line using the Cell processor will be computer workstations and servers. A working version of the PS3 is due to be shown off in May 2005 but a full launch of the next generation console is not expected to start until 2006. ""In the future all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network"" said Ken Kutaragi chief operating officer of Sony said last year. ""Current PC architecture is nearing its limits"" he added. ";;;
0, Intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light.  Scientists at Intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light. The breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information. The Intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade.  ""We've overcome a fundamental limit"" said Dr Mario Paniccia director of Intel's photonics technology lab. Writing in the journal Nature Dr Paniccia - and colleagues Haisheng Rong Richard Jones Ansheng Liu Oded Cohen Dani Hak and Alexander Fang - show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. Currently says Dr Paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it.  Telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved. ""We're trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas"" said Dr Paniccia. While work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances. This is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables. This improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips. Dr Paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material. ""It creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light"" he said. But the Intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light. Even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easy-to-make filters be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies. Semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges. The result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it. Dr Paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses. ""It's a technical validation that it can work"" he said. ";;;
0, Microsoft is working on a new version of its Internet Explorer web browser.  The revamp has been prompted by Microsoft's growing concern with security as well as increased competition from rival browsers. Microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of tech-savvy criminals. Test versions of the new program called IE 7 are due to be released by the summer.  The announcement about Internet Explorer was made by Bill Gates Microsoft chairman and chief software architect during a keynote speech at the RSA Security conference currently being held in San Francisco. Although details were scant Mr Gates said IE7 would include new protections against viruses spyware and phishing scams. This last category of threats involves criminals setting up spoof websites that look identical to those of banks and try to trick people into handing over login and account information.  In a bid to shore up the poor security in IE 6 Microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware. Earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes - some of which were found in the IE browser. Microsoft has also made a series of acquisitions of small firms that specialise in computer security. One of the first fruits of these acquisitions appeared last month with the release of a Microsoft anti-spyware program. An own-brand anti-virus program is due to follow by the end of 2005. The decision to make Internet Explorer 7 is widely seen as a U-turn because before now Microsoft said it had no need to update the browser. Typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the Windows operating system. A new version of IE was widely expected to debut with the next version of Windows codenamed Longhorn which is due to appear in 2006. The current version of Internet Explorer is four years old and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as Firefox and Opera. There are also persistent rumours that search engine Google is poised to produce its own brand browser based on Firefox. In particular the Firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in November 2004. Estimates of how many users Firefox has won over vary widely. According to market statistics gathered by Websidestory Firefox's market share is now about 5% of all users. However other browser stat gatherers say the figure is closer to 15%. Some technical websites report that a majority of their visitors use the Firefox browser. Internet Explorer still dominates with a share of about 90% but this is down from a peak of almost 96% in mid-2004. ";;;
0, A survey conducted by PC Pro Magazine has revealed that many Britons are unhappy with their internet service.  They are fed up with slow speeds high prices and the level of customer service they receive. 17% of readers have switched suppliers and a further 16% are considering changing in the near future. It is particularly bad news for BT the UK's biggest internet supplier with almost three times as many people trying to leave as joining.  A third of the 2000 broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks Tim Danton editor of PC Pro Magazine. ""We expect these figures to leap in 2005. Every month the prices drop and more and more people are trying to switch"" he said. The survey found that BT and Tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription. Some readers were offered a price drop just 25p more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator making it hardly worth while swapping.  Other found themselves tied into 12-month contracts. Broadband has become hugely competitive and providers are desperate to hold on to customers. 12% of those surveyed found themselves unable to swap at all. ""We discovered a huge variety of problems but one of the biggest issues is the current supplier withholding the information that people need to give to their new supplier"" said Tim Danton editor of PC Pro. ""This breaks the code of practice but because that code is voluntary there's nothing we or Ofcom can do to help"" he said. There is a vast choice of internet service providers in the UK now and an often bewildering array of broadband packages. With prices set to drop even further in coming months Mr Danton advises everyone to shop around carefully. ""If you just stick with your current connection then there's every chance you're being ripped off"" he warned. ";;;
0, Sun Microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour.  Sun Grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by Sun. So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity.  The system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed said Sun's chief operating officer Jonathan Schwartz. ""Why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?"" he asked in a webcast launching Sun's quarterly Network Computing event in California. The company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil gas and financial services industries.  Some of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5000 processors each Sun said. Mr Schwartz ran a demonstration of the service showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment. Hundreds of servers were used simultaneously working on the problem for a few seconds each.  Although it only took a few seconds the experiment cost $12 (Â£6.30) because it had used up 12 hour's worth of computing power. The Sun Grid relies on Solaris the operating system owned by Sun. Initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers. It has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in IBM which argues that its capacity on-demand service is cheaper than that offered by Sun. ";;;
0, An Indian telecommunications firm has turned to lasers to help it overcome the problems of setting up voice and data networks in the country.  Tata Teleservices is using the lasers to make the link between customers' offices and its own core network. The laser bridges work across distances up to 4km and can be set up much faster than cable connections. In 12 months the lasers have helped the firm set up networks in more than 700 locations.  ""In this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task"" said Mr R. Sridharan vice president of networks at Tata. ""Heavy traffic and the layout under the ground mean that digging is uniquely difficult"" he said. In some locations he said permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get. He said it was far easier to secure permission for putting networking hardware on roofs. This has led Chennai-based Tata to turn to equipment that uses lasers to make the final mile leap between Tata's core network and the premises of customers. The Lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network. The hardware works in pairs and beam data through the air in the form of laser pulses.  The laser bridges can route data at speeds up to 1.25gbps (2000 times faster than a 512kbps broadband connection) but Tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of 1-2mbps. The lasers are also ideal for India because of its climate. ""It's particularly suitable as the rain rate is a little low and it's hardly ever foggy"" he said. In places where rain is heavy and fog is common laser links can struggle to maintain good connection speeds. The laser links also take far less time to set up and get working said Mr Sridharan. ""Once we get the other permissions normal time period for set up is a few hours"" he said. By contrast he said digging up roads and laying cables can take weeks or months. This speed of set up has helped Tata with its aggressive expansion plans. Just over 12 months ago the firm had customers in only about 70 towns and cities. But by the end of March the firm hopes to reach more than 1000. ""Speed is very important because of the pace of competition"" said Mr Sridharan. ";;;

The company which makes role playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights is seeking people aged 18 to 99. The Canada-based company says it was looking for ""a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters"". Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performer's fee for the use of their image. The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton Alberta on Friday and Saturday bringing along a piece of photo identification.  ""There are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical Bioware game"" said Shauna Perry Bioware's audio and external resources producer. ""Those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people people with interesting faces."" She added: ""Not everyone is a model in the world so we don't want just models in our games."" People chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. Hundreds of photos of the person's head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3D. ""The 3D model will look exactly like the person - it's really quite incredible how detailed they are"" said Ms Perry. She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. ""We cannot give people any control over how the images are used. ""But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one the villain in another and just a merchant in a third."" ";;;

0, The amount of spam circulating online could be about to undergo a massive increase say experts.  Anti-spam group Spamhaus is warning about a novel virus which hides the origins of junk mail. The program makes spam look like it is being sent by legitimate mail servers making it hard to spot and filter out. Spamhaus said that if the problem went unchecked real e-mail messages could get drowned by the sheer amount of junk being sent.  Before now many spammers have recruited home PCs to act as anonymous e-mail relays in an attempt to hide the origins of their junk mail. The PCs are recruited using viruses and worms that compromise machines via known vulnerabilities or by tricking people into opening an attachment infected with the malicious program. Once compromised the machines start to pump out junk mail on behalf of spammers. Spamhaus helps to block junk messages from these machines by collecting and circulating blacklists of net addresses known to harbour infected machines. But the novel worm spotted recently by Spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place. In this way the junk mail gets a net address that looks legitimate. As blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical Spamhaus is worried that the technique will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped. Steve Linford director of Spamhaus predicted that if a lot of spammers exploit this technique it could trigger the failure of the net's e-mail sending infrastructure. David Stanley UK managing director of filtering firm Ciphertrust said the new technique was the next logical step for spammers. ""They are adding to their armoury"" he said. The amount of spam in circulation was still growing said Mr Stanley but he did not think that the appearance of this trick would mean e-mail meltdown. But Kevin Hogan senior manager at Symantec security response said such warnings were premature. ""If something like this mean the end of e-mail then e-mail would have stopped two-three years ago"" said Mr Hogan. While the technique of routing mail via mail servers of net service firms might cause problems for those that use blacklists and block lists it did not mean that other techniques for stopping spam lost their efficacy too. Mr Hogan said 90% of the junk mail filtered by Symantec subsidiary Brightmail was spotted using techniques that did not rely on looking at net addresses. For instance said Mr Hogan filtering out e-mail messages that contain a web link can stop about 75% of spam. ";;;
0, Net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims.  The site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official Disasters Emergency Committee webpage. However DEC has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. The site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster.  The link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating. The message's subject line reads ""Urgent Tsunami Earthquake Appeal"" and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts. The web address of the fake site is decuk.org which could be close enough to the official www.dec.org.uk address to confuse some people keen to donate. Patricia Sanders spokeswoman for the Disaster Emergency Committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the Computer Crime Unit at Scotland Yard to help get it shut down. She said the spam e-mails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered. It is thought that the fake site is being run from Romania. Ms Sanders said DEC had contacted US net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web.  DEC was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation. BT and DEC's hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down she said.  Ms Sanders said sending out spam e-mail to solicit donations was not DEC's style and that it would never canvass support in this way. She said that DEC hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible. All attempts by the BBC News website to contact the people behind the site have failed. None of the e-mail addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records. This is not the first attempt to cash in on the outpouring of goodwill that has accompanied appeals for tsunami aid. One e-mail sent out in early January came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from a bank account in the Netherlands. The con was very similar to the familiar Nigerian forward fee fraud e-mails that milk money out of people by promising them a cut of a much larger cash pile. Other scam e-mails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information. In a monthly report anti-virus firm Sophos said that two e-mail messages about the tsunami made it to the top 10 hoax list during January. Another tsunami-related e-mail is also circulating that carries the Zar worm which tries to spread via the familiar route of Microsoft's Outlook e-mail program. Anyone opening the attachment of the mail will have their contact list plundered by the worm keen to find new addresses to send itself to. ";;;

Picture the scene - Wales are camped on the England line in the dying seconds of the Six Nations' opening match. A ball is flung out to winger Shane Williams who crosses to score the winning try for Wales. But the England players are incensed - arguing that the pass was forward and the try should not stand. In the past sports fans would be left debating the validity of the try for days and weeks to come. But BBC Sport's new tool Piero could end discussions in minutes.  Piero named after the Italian painter and pioneer of perspective Piero della Francesco creates a virtual stadium in which virtual players can be tracked from almost any angle. Viewers will be able to see precisely how the ball was thrown and by whom giving a greater depth to the growing wealth of analysis available during sports broadcasts. The technology has been created by BBC Research and Development for BBC Broadcast and BBC Outside Broadcasts. BBC Sport is the first client to start using the system. ""In order to keep audiences growing and growing... we need to work closely with people who create technology and innovation to bring sport to life"" said Andrew Thompson the BBC's head of development new media and sports news. ""We want to appeal to core fans - to give them more analysis more detail more definitive answers about key passages of play."" Piero works by taking telemetric data from fixed camera positions and sending that data inside the video signal to a PC which can then render the information into 3D graphics.  The more cameras using Piero the better the detail possible out the other end when the data is turned into 3D models. ""It allows us to tell the story of a passage of play tracking individual players across the field looking at tactics"" said Andy Townsend from BBC Broadcast.  An operator can manipulate the information and provide almost real-time replays of incidents as well as more in-depth analysis. The ""virtual camera"" can focus on virtually any aspect of the pitch giving viewers an insight into action that the camera normally cannot see. Piero also provides a wealth of statistical detail - from the length of kicks to the length of a run of an individual player and the height of a lift at any lineout. Mr Townsend said sports performance companies were already showing an interest in the technology. BBC Broadcast hopes the technology can be sold to third parties interested in using it a number of different ways - from sport broadcasting to entertainment and game shows. ";;;
0, The war of words between Microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as Linux founder Linus Torvalds led an attack on software patents.  In a panel discussion at a Linux summit in California Mr Torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement. Mitchell Kapor chairman of the Mozilla foundation warned that Microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future. Linux is a freely-available alternative to Microsoft's Windows. It relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees. The attack on software patents comes at a time when IBM has made 500 of its patents freely available. Other companies are expected to follow suit.  There are between 150000 and 300000 registered software patents in the US and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted. This is a view corroborated by the UK Patent Office. ""Some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they can't afford to take them to court"" said Dr Jeremy Philpott of the UK Patent Office. Some panel members are worried that Microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future. ""If totally pushed to the wall - because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce software...of course they're going to unleash the WMDs"" Mr Kapor is reported as saying. Microsoft did not want to comment directly referring the issue instead to trade body Intellect of which it is a member. ""As far as Intellect is concerned open source and patents have co-existed for many years without problems"" said spokeswoman Jill Sutherland. ""The industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software"" ""We think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries and not be forced into using one or the other"" she added.

0, A European Parliament committee has ordered a rewrite of the proposals for controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions.  The Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the Commission should re-submit the Computer Implemented Inventions Directive after MEPs failed to back it. It has had vocal critics who say it could favour large over small firms and impact open-source software innovation. Supporters say it would let firms protect their inventions. The directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect in other words ""computer implemented invention"". The draft law suffered setbacks when Poland one of the largest EU member states rejected its adoption twice in two months. Intense lobbying on the issue has started to gain momentum in some national parliaments putting them under immense pressure. Only two MEPs backed the draft law at the JURI meeting with one voting to abstain.  Opponents of the draft directive welcomed the decision and said a new first reading of the proposals would give the EU a chance to have fuller debates about its implications in all member states. In the US the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its ""one-click shopping"" service for example. Critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in Europe. This they fear could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US. ";;;
0, Fake bank e-mails or phishing and stories about ID theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce say e-business experts.  Trust in online security is falling as a result. Almost 70% of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people. The survey of more than 1000 people reported that 43% were not willing to hand over personal information online. It is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net. More people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats said security firm RSA which carried out the poll. An estimated 12 million Britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs. Security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging e-commerce and e-banking are being taken seriously - by banks in particular.  ""I don't think the threat is overplayed"" Barry Beal global security manager for Capgemini told the BBC News website. He added: ""The challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability."" Ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too as well as the individual and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud he said. ""Card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves. If we do that they will indemnify us"" he said. Many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though. One of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual's identity. Several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords which are easily compromised and easy to forget. Last year a street survey found that more than 70% of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate.  On average people have to remember four different passwords. Some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts. Those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer. In a separate survey by RSA 80% said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems. For many the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard.  Activcard is just one of the many companies like RSA Security which has been trying to come up with just that. RSA has a deal with internet provider AOL that lets people pay monthly for a one-time passcode generation service. Users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for 60 seconds. Many companies use a token-based method already for employees to access networks securely already. Activcard's method is more complex. It is currently trailing its one-time passcode generation technology with UK banks. Steve Ash from Activcard told the BBC News website there are two parts to the process of identification. The most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online.  ""The end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both."" The method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time. This can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as 30 seconds before it changes. It combines that with usual usernames and passwords as well as other security questions. ""You take the card put it in the reader enter your pin number and a code is given. ""If you wanted then to transfer funds for instance you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction."" The clever bit happens back at the bank's secure servers. The code is validated by the bank's systems matching the information they expect with the customer's unique key. ""Each individual gets a key which is unique to them. It is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack"" said Mr Ash. It means that in a typical security attack explains Mr Ash even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites they need the passcode. ""By the time they go back [to use the information] the code has expired so they can't prove who they are"" according to Mr Ash. In the next few years Mr Ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use. ""PCs will have readers built into them the cost of readers will be very cheap and more people will have the cards."" The gadgets we carry around like personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobiles could also have integrated card reader technology in them. ""The PDA or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around"" he said. ";;;
0, Third-generation mobile (3G) networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services.  That was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3GSM World Congress in Cannes last week. Fast 3G networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service says the Global Mobile Suppliers Association. At 3GSM Siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data. The German company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to 20 times faster than current 3G networks. The system is not available commercially yet but Motorola the US mobile handset and infrastructure maker held a clinic for mobile operators on HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access) a high-speed high bandwidth technology available now. Early HSDPA systems typically offer around two megabits per second (Mbps) compared with less than 384 kilobits per second (Kbps) on standard 3G networks.  ""High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) - sometimes called Super 3G - will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips"" according to a report published by UK-based research consultancy Analysys. A number of companies are developing the technology. Nokia and Canada-based wireless communication products company Sierra Wireless recently agreed to work together on High Speed Downlink Packet Access. The two companies aim to jointly market the HSDPA solution to global network operator customers.  ""While HSDPA theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14Mbps practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks"" said Dr Alastair Brydon author of the Analysys report: Pushing Beyond the Limits of 3G with HSDPA and Other Enhancements. ""The typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which even at this lower rate will more than double the capacity... when compared to basic WCDMA [3G]"" he added. Motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9Mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3G cell using a single HSDPA device. But some mobile operators are opting for a technology called Evolution Data Optimised (EV-DO).  US operator Sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its 3G network at the end of last year. We are ""expanding our network and deploying EV-DO technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds"" said Oliver Valente Sprint's vice president for technology development when the contract was announced. As part of $3bn in multi-year contracts announced late last year Sprint will spend around $1bn on EV-DO technology from Lucent Technologies Nortel Networks and Motorola that provides average data speeds of 0.3-0.5 megabits a second and peak download rates of 2.4Mbps. MMO2 the UK-based operator with services in the UK Ireland and Germany has opted for technology based on the High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) standard. Using technology from Lucent it will offer data speeds of 3.6Mbps from next summer on its Isle of Man 3G network and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4Mbps. US operator Cingular Wireless is also adopting HSDPA using technology from Lucent alongside equipment from Siemens and Ericsson.  Siemens' plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today but Christoph Caselitz president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that: ""By the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015 the need for transmission capacities for voice data image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10."" Siemens - in collaboration with the Fraunhofer German-Sino Lab for Mobile Communications and the Institute for Applied Radio System Technology - has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae instead of the usual one. This enables a data transmission such as sending a big file or video to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band. The speeds offered by3G mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3G licences. But today instead of connecting to the internet by slow dial-up phone connection many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits a second - must faster than 3G. This means users are likely to find 3G disappointing unless the networks are souped up. If they aren't those lucrative ""power users"" such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators. But one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately. Siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory it still has to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae devices and conduct field trials. A commercial system could be as far away as 2012 though Siemens did not rule out an earlier date. ";;;
0, The ""digital divide"" between rich and poor nations is narrowing fast according to a World Bank report.  The World Bank questioned a United Nation's campaign to increase usage and access to technology in poorer nations. ""People in the developing world are getting more access at an incredible rate - far faster than... in the past"" said the report. But a spokesman for the UN's World Summit on the Information Society said the digital divide remained very real. ""The digital divide is rapidly closing"" the World Bank report said.  Half the world's population now has access to a fixed-line telephone the report said and 77% to a mobile network.  The report's figures surpass a WSIS campaign goal that calls for 50% access to telephones by 2015. The UN hopes that widening access to technology such as mobile phones and the net will help eradicate poverty. ""Developing countries are catching up with the rich world in terms of access [to mobile networks]"" the report said. ""Africa is part of a worldwide trend of rapid rollout... this applies to countries rich and poor reformed or not African Asian European and Latin American.""  A spokesman for the World Summit for the Information Society (WSIS) which is meeting this week in Geneva told the BBC News website: ""The digital divide is very much real and needs to be addressed. ""Some financing has to be found to help narrow the divide."" On Tuesday a meeting of the WSIS in Geneva agreed to the creation of a Digital Solitary Fund. ""The fund is voluntary and will help finance local community-based projects"" said the WSIS spokesman. Under the proposals agreed voluntary contribution of 1% on contracts obtained by private technology service providers could be made to the Digital Solidarity Fund. The exact financing mechanism of the fund is to be ironed out in the coming days said the WSIS. Sixty percent of resources collected by the fund will be made available for projects in least developed countries 30% for projects in developing countries and 10% for projects in developed countries.

0, A rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems is being launched by the UK government.  The service IT Safe will issue warnings about damaging viruses software vulnerabilities and weaknesses on devices such as mobile phones. Alerts tell people how the threats affect them and what they can do to avoid trouble and protect themselves. The service will be free and those who sign up can get e-mail or text alerts. The scheme is aimed at home users and small businesses. The government estimates it will issue security alerts about six to 10 times a year based on previous experience of virus outbreaks. ""There is a clear need for easy-to-understand and simple independent advice for non-technically minded people who use computers either at home or at work"" said Home Office Minister Hazel Blears. ""The purpose of this new government service is to ensure computer users are aware of the risks involved and how to deal with them easily and effectively without causing alarm."" Those signing up will only be told about the most serious security threats that have the potential to affect millions of people.  Full-time staff are being employed to comb through the many hundreds of alerts issued each year by computer security firms to spot which ones have the potential to catch out a large number of people Between alerts the service will occasionally send messages giving people advice about safe ways to use their computers and phones. ""IT Safe will take our technical expertise and use it to help home users understand the risks and keep their computer systems mobile phones and a range of related consumer electronic items safe"" said Roger Cumming director of the National Infrastructure Security Coordination Centre (NISCC).  The NISCC which is running the service also stressed that those signing up would still need to use anti-virus software firewalls and software updates to stay secure. Warnings about security problems will tell people what the problem is how it affects them and what they can do to avoid trouble. Alerts will not be issued unless users can do something to protect themselves against the threat. This might include downloading an update from an anti-virus vendor or updating software to close loopholes and fix vulnerabilities. However no software patches or programs will actually be dispensed through the site. The alerts will tell people how to go about getting hold of patches from security firms. The NISCC spokesman said the site and alerting service would stay in existence for as long as there were security bugs on home computers and other gadgets.  Government statistics show that more than half of all UK households own a home computer. It was estimated that almost 13 million of these were able to access the internet in 2004. The launch comes as the number of viruses and other malicious programs in existence is reaching unprecedented numbers. In September 2004 the number of malicious programs circulating topped the 100000 mark. Some fear that this figure could hit 150000 by September 2005. The creation of the national alert service follows similar efforts in the Netherlands and US. The National Alerting Service for the Netherlands (aka De Waarschuwingsdienst) and the US National Cyber Alerting Service also tell citizens of serious security threats. ";;;
0, An Iranian weblogger has been jailed for 14 years on charges of spying and aiding foreign counter-revolutionaries.  Arash Sigarchi was arrested last month after using his blog to criticise the arrest of other online journalists. Mr Sigarchi who also edits a newspaper in northern Iran was sentenced by a revolutionary court in the Gilan area. His sentence criticised by human rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders comes a day after an online ""day of action"" to secure his release. Iranian authorities have recently clamped down on the growing popularity of weblogs restricting access to major blogging sites from within Iran. A second Iranian blogger Motjaba Saminejad who also used his website to report on bloggers' arrests is still being held.  A spokesman for Reporters Without Borders which tracks press freedom across the globe described Mr Sigarchi's sentence as ""harsh"" and called on Iranian President Mohammed Khatami to work to secure his immediate release. ""The authorities are trying to make an example of him"" the organisation said in a statement.  ""By handing down this harsh sentence against a weblogger their aim is to dissuade journalists and internet-users from expressing themselves online or contacting foreign media."" In the days before his arrest Mr Sigarchi gave interviews to the BBC Persian Service and the US-funded Radio Farda. Iranian authorities have arrested about 20 online journalists during the current crackdown. They accused Mr Sigarchi of a string of crimes against Iranian state including espionage insulting the founder of Iran's Islamic Republic Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei and current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mr Sigarchi's lawyer labelled the revolutionary court ""illegal and incompetent"" and called for a retrial in a public court.  Mr Sigarchi was sentenced one day after an online campaign highlighted his case in a day of action in defence of bloggers around the world.  The Committee to Protect Bloggers designated 22 February 2005 as Free Mojtaba and Arash Day. Around 10000 people visited the campaign's website during the day. About 12% of users were based in Iran the campaign's director told the BBC News website. Curt Hopkins said Mr Sigarchi's sentence would not dent the resolve of bloggers joining the campaign to help highlight the case. ""The eyes of 8 million bloggers are going to be more focused on Iran since Sigarchi's sentence not less. ""The mullahs won't be able to make a move without it be spread across the blogosphere.""

0, Microsoft is investigating a trojan program that attempts to switch off the firm's anti-spyware software.  The spyware tool was only released by Microsoft in the last few weeks and has been downloaded by six million people. Stephen Toulouse a security manager at Microsoft said the malicious program was called Bankash-A Trojan and was being sent as an e-mail attachment. Microsoft said it did not believe the program was widespread and recommended users to use an anti-virus program. The program attempts to disable or delete Microsoft's anti-spyware tool and suppress warning messages given to users.  It may also try to steal online banking passwords or other personal information by tracking users' keystrokes.  Microsoft said in a statement it is investigating what it called a criminal attack on its software. Earlier this week Microsoft said it would buy anti-virus software maker Sybari Software to improve its security in its Windows and e-mail software. Microsoft has said it plans to offer its own paid-for anti-virus software but it has not yet set a date for its release. The anti-spyware program being targeted is currently only in beta form and aims to help users find and remove spyware - programs which monitor internet use causes advert pop-ups and slow a PC's performance.

0, A US woman is suing Hewlett Packard (HP) saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date.  The unnamed woman from Georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the US who has purchased an HP inkjet printer since February 2001. HP the world's biggest printer firm declined to comment on the lawsuit. HP ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change.  But the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty. ""The smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer"" the suit said. The lawsuit is asking for restitution damages and other compensation. The cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in Europe for the last 18 months. The price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as Â£34 but it could cost up to Â£1700 in running costs over an 18-month period due to cartridge a study by Computeractive Magazine revealed last year. The inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the UK's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) which concluded in a 2002 report that retailers and manufacturers needed to make pricing more transparent for consumers.

0, The movie industry has struck out at file-sharing networks with another round of lawsuits in the US.  The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) also said it had succeeded in getting a network called LokiTorrent closed down. It is the latest network which uses the peer-to-peer system called BitTorrent to be hit by the MPAA. The MPAA began its legal campaign against operators of similar networks across four continents in December. A Dallas court agreed that Hollywood lawyers would be allowed access to LokiTorrent's server records which could let them single out those who were sharing files illegally. In October 2004 the site had provided links to more than 30000 files. The action came after the operators of LokiTorrent agreed a settlement with the MPAA. A stark message has appeared on the site from the MPAA warning ""You can click but you can't hide"". In BitTorrent systems server sites do not host the files being shared. They host links called ""trackers"" that direct people to others that have it instead.  As well as filing an unspecified number of file suits across the US the MPAA said it had given operators that host eDonkey servers ""take down"" notices. Hollywood studios are aggressively clamping down on file-sharers who it says infringe copyright laws by copying films and TV programmes then share the files online. But it is now targeting the operators of BitTorrent networks themselves. It has filed 100 lawsuits against operators of BitTorrent server sites since December. The strategy of hitting those who run the servers which link to copyrighted material is intended to stunt file-sharers' ability to swap content using BitTorrent systems. The film industry says the black market for illegally copied videos and DVDs already costs them billions every year and it is worried that illegal file-sharing is adding to their losses. In December the legal action claimed its most high-profile victim. The popular Suprnova.org website was forced to close and others like Phoenix Torrent followed soon after. ";;;
0, The US Federal Bureau of Investigation is warning that a computer virus is being spread via e-mails that purport to be from the FBI.  The e-mails show that they have come from an fbi.gov address and tell recipients that they have accessed illegal websites. The messages warn that their internet use has been monitored by the FBI's Internet Fraud Complaint Center. An attachment in the e-mail contains the virus the FBI said. The message asks recipients to click on the attachment and answer some questions about their internet use. But rather than being a questionnaire the attachment contains a virus that infects the recipient's computer according to the agency. It is not clear what the virus does once it has infected a computer. Users are warned never to open attachment from unsolicited e-mails or from people they do not know.  ""Recipients of this or similar solicitations should know that the FBI does not engage in the practice of sending unsolicited e-mails to the public in this manner"" the FBI said in a statement. The bureau is investigating the phoney e-mails. The agency earlier this month shut down fbi.gov accounts used to communicate with the public because of a security breach. A spokeswoman said the two incidents appear to be unrelated. ";;;
0, Apple has expanded its iPod family with the release of its next generation of the digital music players.  Its latest challenges to the growing digital music gadget market include an iPod mini model which can hold 6GB compared to a previous 4GB. The company which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped. A 30GB version has also been added to the iPod Photo family. The latest models have a longer battery life and their prices have been cut by an average of Â£40. The original iPod took an early lead in the digital music player market thanks to its large storage capacity and simple design.  During 2004 about 25 million portable players were sold 10 million of which were Apple iPods. But analysts agree that the success is also down to its integration with the iTunes online store which has given the company a 70% share of the legal download music market. Mike McGuire a research director at analyst Gartner told the BBC News website that Apple had done a good job in ""sealing off the market from competition"" so far. ""They have created a very seamless package which I think is the idea of the product - the design function and the software are very impressive"" he said. He added that the threat from others was always present however. ""Creative other Microsoft-partnered devices Real Sony and so on are ratcheting up the marketing message and advertising"" he said. Creative was very upbeat about how many of its Creative Zen players it had shipped by the end of last year he said. Its second-generation models like the Creative Zen Micro Photo is due out in the summer. It will have 5GB of memory on board.  Digital music players are now the gadget of choice among young Americans according to recent research by the Pew Internet and American Life Project. One in 10 US adults - 22 million people - now owns a digital music player of some sort. Sales of legally downloaded songs also rose more than tenfold in 2004 according to the record industry with 200 million tracks bought online in the US and Europe in 12 months. The IFPI industry body said that the popularity of portable music players was behind the growth. Analysts say that the ease of use and growth of music services available on the net will continue to drive the trend towards portable music players.  People are also starting to use them in novel ways. Some are combining automatic syncing functions many of them have with other net functions to automatically distribute DIY radio shows called podcasts. But 2005 will also see more competition from mobile phone operators who are keen to offer streaming services on much more powerful and sophisticated handsets. According to Mr McGuire research suggests that people like the idea of building up huge libraries of music which they can do with high-capacity storage devices like iPods and Creative Zens. Mobiles do not yet have this capacity though and there are issues about the ease of portability of mobile music. Mr McGuire said Apple was ensuring it kept a foot in the mobile music door with its recent deal with Motorola to produce a version of iTunes for Motorola phones. ";;;
0, T-Mobile has launched its latest ""pocket office"" third-generation (3G) device which also has built-in wi-fi - high-speed wireless net access.  Unlike other devices where the user has to check which high-speed network is available to transfer data the device selects the fastest one itself. The MDA IV released in the summer is an upgrade to the company's existing smartphone the 2.5G/wi-fi MDA III. It reflects the push by mobile firms for devices that are like mini laptops. The device has a display that can be swivelled and angled so it can be used like a small computer or as a conventional clamshell phone. The Microsoft Mobile phone with two cameras and a Qwerty keyboard reflects the design of similar all-in-one models released this year such as Motorola's MPx. ""One in five European workers are already mobile - meaning they spend significant time travelling and out of the office"" Rene Obermann T-Mobile's chief executive told a press conference at the 3GSM trade show in Cannes. He added: ""What they need is their office when they are out of the office."" T-Mobile said it was seeing increasing take up for what it calls ""Office in a Pocket"" devices with 100000 MDAs sold in Europe already.  In response to demand T-Mobile also said it would be adding the latest phone-shaped Blackberry to its mobile range. Reflecting the growing need to be connected outside the office it announced it would introduce a flat-fee Â£20 ($38) a month wi-fi tariff for people in the UK using its wi-fi hotspots. It said it would nearly double the number of its hotspots - places where wi-fi access is available - globally from 12300 to 20000.  It also announced it was installing high-speed wi-fi on certain train services such as the UK's London to Brighton service to provide commuters a fast net connection too. The service which has been developed with Southern trains Nomad Digital (who provide the technology) begins with a free trial on 16 trains on the route from early March to the end of April. A full service is set to follow in the summer. Wi-fi access points will be connected to a Wimax wireless network - faster than wi-fi - running alongside the train tracks. Brian McBride managing director of T-Mobile in the UK said: ""We see a growing trend for business users needing to access e-mail securely on the move.  ""We are able to offer this by maintaining a constant data session for the entire journey."" He said this was something other similar in-train wi-fi services such as that offered on GNER trains did not offer yet. Mr Obermann added that the mobile industry in general was still growing with many more opportunities for more services which would bear fruit for mobile companies in future. Thousands of mobile industry experts are gathered in Cannes France for the 3GSM which runs from 14 to 17 February. ";;;

Wireless provider Broadreach and net telephony firm Skype are rolling out a service at 350 hotspots around the UK this week. Users will need a Skype account - downloadable for free - and they will then be able to make net calls via wi-fi without paying for net access. Skype allows people to make free PC-based calls to other Skype users.  Users of the system can also make calls to landlines and mobiles for a fee. The system is gaining in popularity and now has 28 million users around the world. Its paid service - dubbed Skype Out - has so far attracted 940000 users. It plans to add more paid services with forthcoming launches of video conferencing voice mail and Skype In a service which would allow users to receive phone calls from landlines and mobiles. London-based software developer Connectotel has unveiled software that will expand the SMS functions of Skype allowing users to send text messages to mobile phones from the service. Broadreach Networks has around two million users and hotspots in places such as Virgin Megastores the Travelodge chain of hotels and all London's major rail terminals. The company is due to launch wi-fi on Virgin Trains later in the year. ""Skype's success at spreading the world about internet telephony is well-known and we are delighted to be offering free access to Skype users in our hotspots"" commented Broadreach chief executive Magnus McEwen-King.

The pirated DVD market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago. Macrovision says its new RipGuard technology will thwart most but not all of the current DVD ripping (copying) programs used to pirate DVDs. ""RipGuard is designed to... reduce DVD ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer"" said the firm. Macrovision said the new technology will work in ""nearly all"" current DVD players when applied to the discs but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with RipGuard. The new technology will be welcomed by Hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from DVD sales.  The film industry has stepped up efforts to fight DVD piracy in the last 12 months taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of DVD movies for download.  ""Ultimately we see RipGuard DVD... evolving beyond anti-piracy and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions interoperability in tomorrow's digital home and the upcoming high-definition formats"" said Steve Weinstein executive vice president and general manager of Macrovision's Entertainment Technologies Group. Macrovision said RipGuard was designed to plug the ""digital hole"" that was created by so-called DeCSS ripper software. It circumvents Content Scrambling System measures placed on DVDs and let people make perfect digital copies of copyrighted DVDs in minutes. Those copies could then be burned onto a blank DVD or uploaded for exchange to a peer-to-peer network. Macrovision said RipGuard would also prevent against ""rent rip and return"" - where people would rent a DVD copy it and then return the original. RipGuard is expected to be rolled out on DVDs from the middle of 2005 the company said. The new system works specifically to block most ripping programs - if used those programs will now most likely crash the company said. Macrovision has said that Rip Guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti-copying measures. ";;;
0, Civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has joined a legal fight between three US online journalists and Apple.  Apple wants the reporters to reveal 20 sources used for stories which leaked information about forthcoming products including the Mac Mini. The EFF representing the reporters has asked California's Superior court to stop Apple pursuing the sources. It argues that the journalists are protected by the American constitution. The EFF says the case threatens the basic freedoms of the press.  Apple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named Asteroid and has asked the journalists' e-mail providers to hand over communications relevant to that. ""Rather than confronting the issue of reporter's privilege head-on Apple is going to the journalist's ISPs for his e-mails"" said EFF lawyer Kurt Opsahl. ""This undermines a fundamental First Amendment right that protects all reporters. ""If the court lets Apple get away with this and exposes the confidences gained by these reporters potential confidential sources will be deterred from providing information to the media and the public will lose a vital outlet for independent news analysis and commentary"" he said. The case began in December 2004 when Apple asked a local Californian court to get the journalists to reveal their sources for articles published on websites AppleInsider.com and PowerPage.org.  Apple also sent requested information from the Nfox.com the internet service provider of PowerPage's publisher Jason O-Grady. As well as looking at how far corporations can go in preventing information from being published the case will also examine whether online journalists have the same privileges and protections as those writing for newspapers and magazines. The EFF has gained some powerful allies in its legal battle with Apple including Professor Tom Goldstein former dean of the Journalism School at the University of California and Dan Gillmor a well-known Silicon Valley journalist. Apple was not immediately available for comment. ";;;
0, Sony's Playstation Portable is the top gadget for 2005 according to a round-up of ultimate gizmos compiled by Stuff Magazine.  It beats the iPod into second place in the Top Ten Essentials list which predicts what gadget-lovers are likely to covet this year. Owning all 10 gadgets will set the gadget lover back Â£7455. That is Â£1000 cheaper than last year's list due to falling manufacturing costs making gadgets more affordable.  Portable gadgets dominate the list including Sharp's 902 3G mobile phone the Pentax Optio SV digital camera and Samsung's Yepp YH-999 video jukebox.  ""What this year's Essentials shows is that gadgets are now cheaper sexier and more indispensable than ever. We've got to the point where we can't live our lives without certain technology"" said Adam Vaughan editor of Stuff Essentials. The proliferation of gadgets in our homes is inexorably altering the role of the high street in our lives thinks Mr Vaughan. ""Take digital cameras who would now pay to develop an entire film of photos? Or legitimate downloads who would travel miles to a record shop when they could download the song in minutes for 70p?"" he asks. Next year will see a new set of technologies capturing the imaginations of gadget lovers Stuff predicts. The Xbox 2 high-definition TV and MP3 mobiles will be among the list of must-haves that will dominate 2006 it says. The spring launch of the PSP in the UK is eagerly awaited by gaming fans. ";;;

The National Theatre's Stagework website picked up the prize for best learning as well as top factual site. The BBC collected three awards including best online entertainment for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Adventure Game. Spooks Interactive took the best interactive TV prize. The annual awards recognise the best in digital media. BBC Sport Interactive fought off competition from CBBC Newsround and the Guardian to take home the best news and sport trophy for its coverage of England's exit from Euro 2004. It was recognised for its ""groundbreaking"" use of animation. Bafta's Grant Dean chair of Bafta's Interactive Entertainment committee said all the entrants had been of ""outstanding quality"" and that judging had been ""enormously difficult"". ""Without a doubt 2005 has been a landmark year for the Bafta Interactive Awards"" he added.  ""Many of the top awards this year have gone to the companies we most commonly associate with traditional entertainment showing how the gap between new media film and television is closing.""  Awards were given out in 12 different categories including interactive TV film music design as well as technical and social innovation at a London ceremony. The top music award was given to SSEYO miniMIXA a mobile music sequencer designed to let people write edit and share compositions. Warner Bros was given two prizes for its ""inspiring"" efforts in film and DVD interactivity. The Chaplin Collection beat Oasis Really Bend It Like Beckham Shaun of the Dead and The Day Today in the DVD category and Trauma won best film. Elsewhere fashionista and clothes designer Alexander McQueen took the accolade for the best-designed website. The awards have been running since 1997 but in 2002 the British Academy of Film and Television decided to split them into separate games and interactive ceremonies. On Tuesday Half-Life 2 dominated the games prizes. It collected six Baftas including best game and best online game. ";;;
0, One in 10 adult Americans - equivalent to 22 million people - owns an MP3 player according to a survey.  A study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that MP3 players are the gadget of choice among affluent young Americans. The survey did not interview teenagers but it is likely that millions of under-18s also have MP3 players. The American love affair with digital music players has been made possible as more and more homes get broadband.  Of the 22 million Americans who own MP3 players 59% are men compared to 41% of women. Those on high income - judged to be $75000 (Â£39000) or above - are four times more likely to have players than those earning less than $30 000 ( Â£15000). Broadband access plays a big part in ownership too. Almost a quarter of those with broadband at home have players compared to 9% of those who have dial-up access. MP3 players are still the gadget of choice for younger adults. Almost one in five US citizens aged under 30 have one. This compares to 14% of those aged 30-39 and 14% of those aged 40-48. The influence of children also plays a part. Sixteen percent of parents living with children under 18 have digital players compared to 9% of those who don't. The ease of use and growth of music available on the net are the main factors for the upsurge in ownership the survey found. People are beginning to use them as instruments of social activity - sharing songs and taking part in podcasting - the survey found. ""IPods and MP3 players are becoming a mainstream technology for consumers"" said Lee Rainie director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project. ""More growth in the market is inevitable as new devices become available as new players enter the market and as new social uses for iPods/MP3 players become popular"" he added. ";;;
0, A proposed European law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the European Commission (EC) despite requests by MEPs.  The law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. Some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms The EC says the Council of Ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last May but said it would review ""all aspects of the directive"". The directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect in other words ""computer implemented invention"".  In a letter EC President Jos&#233";" Manuel Barroso told the President of the European Parliament Josep Borrell that the Commission ""did not intend to refer a new proposal to the Parliament and the Council (of ministers)"" as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in May 2004.  If the European Council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the European Parliament. But that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. Most EU legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the Council of Ministers before it becomes law. French Green MEP Alain Lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the Commission ignored the Parliament's request it would be an ""insult"" to the assembly. He said that the parliament would then reject the Council's version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure. In the US the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted.  This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its ""one-click shopping"" service for example. Critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in Europe. This they fear could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US. ";;
0, A system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like Cyrillic could open a back door for scammers a trade body has warned.  The Internationalised Domain Names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the Internet Electronic Task Force. But the UK Internet Forum (UKIF) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. The problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language.  Registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers says Stephen Dyer director of UKIF. Domain names are the ""real language"" addresses of websites rather than their internet protocol address which is a series of numbers. They are used so people can more easily navigate the web. So-called ASCII codes are used to represent European languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called Unicode is used. So for example website PayPal could now be coded using a mixture of the Latin alphabet and the Russian alphabet. The resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a Russian 'a' look just like an English 'a'. But the computer code would be different and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. This is more than just a theory. A fake Paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant Verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) system said Mr Dyer. As the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to Paypal but it sets a worrying precedent Mr Dyer said. ""Although the IDN problem is well known in technical circles the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked"" said Mr Dyer.  ""It is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site"" he added. There are solutions. For instance browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. Mr Dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world's browsers. Another solution to introduce IDN-disabled browsers could be a case of ""throwing out the baby with the bath water"" he said. CENTR the Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries agrees. ""A rush to introduce IDN-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in IDNs - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-English speaking world"" the organisation said in a statement.

0, A mobile phone chip which combines a modem and a computer processor on one bit of silicon instead of two could make phones cheaper and more powerful.  The specially-designed chip developed by Texas Instruments could drive down the cost of making mobiles capable of 3D gaming and 30-frame-a-second video. Currently rich multimedia features tend to be on more expensive handsets. The technology OMAP-Vox is being tested by firms in Europe and Asia and could appear by the end of the year. Texas which makes computer chips for more than half the world's mobile phones said it was keen to make multimedia functions like video and gaming more affordable. ""We're going to drive them down into meat-and-potatoes phones that have the largest market share"" said Doug Rasor a marketing vice president at Texas. The chip also uses much less power than conventional chips said Texas which means less strain on mobile battery life.  More than 50 million people own a mobile in the UK but mobile operators are keen to encourage people to move onto more sophisticated handsets that can do more. Texas is keen to cash in on the third generation (3G) of mobile technology which offers high-speed networks for video streaming and other multimedia functions. But it faces stiff competition from the likes of Intel which is also looking to provide better chips for high-end mobiles.  Competition to get people using 3G mobiles will grow in the next year as almost all of the UK's operators have now launched third generation networks. A recent survey by Sony Ericsson predicted that the number of 3G handsets sold in 2005 would double from 2004 to account for 10% of all phones sold. Many consumers are still to be convinced though. A further recent survey said that only 4% of mobile owners were thinking of upgrading to 3G phones. Many said they were confused about the different ways to pay for phones and the vast array of features most have onboard.  But there will be continued demand for better chips as the industry continues to develop new standards and future networks. Earlier in January NTT DoCoMo and Vodafone joined forces to develop the next generation of high-speed networks known as ""super 3G"" intended to be 10 times faster than 3G services. The first stage of development is to be completed by 2007 but no date has been set for a commercial launch The newly-designed OMAP-Vox chip set was announced ahead of the start of a major mobile industry conference 3GSM which takes place in Cannes France this week.

0, A blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps.  Victor Wong a graduate student from Hong Kong studying at Cornell University in New York State had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research. To study ""space weather"" Mr Wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models. A number of solutions were tried including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in Braille. Mr Wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work.  ""The images have three dimensions and I had to find a way of reading them myself"" Mr Wong told the BBC News website. ""For the sake of my own study - and for the sake of blind scientists generally - I felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images."" He tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. In order to have an exact reference to the screen a pen and tablet device is used. The software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. Mr Wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally. ""If I took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it it wouldn't work that well.""  Mr Wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a ""colour memory"" makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision. ""As the notes increase in pitch I know the colour's getting redder and redder and in my mind's eye a patch of red appears."" The colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially and Mr Wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable. But he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images. ";;;
0, Details of the next generation of Microsoft's Xbox games console - codenamed Xenon - will most likely be unveiled in May according to reports.  It was widely expected that gamers would get a sneak preview of Xbox's successor at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March. But a Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed that it would not be at GDC. Sony Microsoft and Nintendo are all expected to release their more powerful machines in the next 18 months. The next Xbox console is expected to go on sale at the end of the year but very few details about it have been released. It is thought that the machine may be unveiled at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles which takes place in May according to a Reuters news agency report. E3 concentrates on showing off the latest in gaming to publishers marketers and retailers. The GDC is aimed more at game developers. Microsoft chief Bill Gates used the GDC event to unveil the original Xbox five years ago. Since its launch Microsoft has sold 19.9 million units worldwide.  At the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this year there was very little mention of the next generation gaming machine. In his keynote speech Mr Gates only referred to it as playing an essential part of his vision of the digital lifestyle.  But the battle between the rival consoles to win gamers' hearts and thumbs will be extremely hard-fought. Sony has traditionally dominated the console market with its PlayStation 2. But earlier this year Microsoft said it had reached a European milestone selling five million consoles since its European launch in March 2002. Hit games like Halo 2 which was released in November helped to buoy the sales figures.  Gamers are looking forward to the next generation of machines because they will have much more processing and graphical power.  They are also likely to pack in more features and technologies that make them more central as entertainment and communications hubs. Although details of PlayStation 3 Xenon and Nintendo's so-called Revolution are yet to be finalised developers are already working on titles. Rory Armes studio general manager for games giant Electronic Arts (EA) in Europe recently told the BBC News website in an interview that EA was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines. Microsoft had delivered development kits to EA but he said the company was still waiting on Sony and Nintendo's kits. But he added the PlayStation 3 was rumoured to have ""a little more under the hood [than Xbox 2]"". ";;;
0, Microsoft has unveiled the finished version of its home-grown search engine.  The now formally launched MSN search site takes the training wheels off the test version unveiled in November 2003. The revamped engine indexes more pages than before can give direct answers to factual questions and features tools to help people create detailed queries. Microsoft faces challenges establishing itself as a serious search site because of the intense competition for queries.  Google still reigns supreme as the site people turn to most often when they go online to answer a query keep up with news or search for images. But in the last year Google has faced greater competition than ever for users as old rivals such as Yahoo and Microsoft and new entrants such as Amazon and Blinkx try to grab some of the searching audience for themselves. This renewed interest has come about because of the realisation that many of the things people do online begin with a search for information - be it for a particular web page recipe book gadget news story image or anything else. Microsoft is keen to make its home-grown search engine a significant rival to Google. To generate its corpus of data Microsoft has indexed 5 billion webpages and claims to update its document index every two days - more often than rivals. The Microsoft search engine can also answer specific queries directly rather than send people to a page that might contain the answer.  For its direct answer feature Microsoft is calling on its Encarta encyclopaedia to provide answers to questions about definitions facts calculations conversions and solutions to equations. Tony Macklin director of product at Ask Jeeves pointed out that its search engine has been answering specific queries this way since April 2003. ""The major search providers have moved beyond delivering only algorithmic search so in many ways Microsoft is following the market"" he said. Tools sitting alongside the MSN search engine allow users to refine results to specific websites countries regions or languages. Microsoft is also using so-called ""graphic equalisers"" that let people adjust the relevance of terms to get results that are more up-to-date or more popular. The company said that user feedback from earlier test versions had been used to refine the workings of the finished system. The test or beta version of the MSN search engine unveiled in November had a few teething troubles. On its first day many new users keen to try it were greeted with a page that said the site had been overwhelmed. ";;;
0, A mobile phone that recognises and responds to movements has been launched in Japan.  The motion-sensitive phone - officially titled the V603SH - was developed by Sharp and launched by Vodafone's Japanese division. Devised mainly for mobile gaming users can also access other phone functions using a pre-set pattern of arm movements. The phone will allow golf fans to improve their swing via a golfing game.  Those who prefer shoot-'em-ups will be able to use the phone like a gun to shoot the zombies in the mobile version of Sega's House of the Dead. The phone comes with a tiny motion-control sensor a computer chip that responds to movement.  Other features include a display screen that allows users to watch TV and can rotate 180 degrees. It also doubles up as an electronic musical instrument. Users have to select a sound from a menu that includes clapping tambourine and maracas and shake their phone to create a beat. It is being recommended for the karaoke market. The phone will initially be available in Japan only and is due to go on sale in mid-February. The new gadget could make for interesting people-watching among Japanese commuters who are able to access their mobiles on the subway. Fishing afficiandos in South Korea are already using a phone that allows them to simulate the movement of a rod. The PH-S6500 phone dubbed a sports-leisure gadget was developed by Korean phone giant Pantech and can also be used by runners to measure calorie consumption and distance run. ";;;
0, Spam traffic is up by 40% putting the total amount of e-mail that is junk up to an astonishing 90%.  The figures from e-mail management firm Email Systems will alarm firms attempting to cope with the amount of spam in their in-boxes. While virus traffic has slowed down denial of service attacks are on the increase according to the firm. Virus mail accounts for just over 15% of all e-mail traffic analysis by the firm has found.  It is no longer just multi-nationals that are in danger of so-called denial of service attacks in which websites are bombarded by requests for information and rendered inaccessible. Email Systems refers to a small UK-based engineering firm which received a staggering 12 million e-mails in January. The type of spam currently being sent has subtlety altered in the last few months according to Email Systems analysis. Half of spam received since Christmas has been health-related with gambling and porn also on the increase. Scam mails offering ways to make a quick buck have declined by 40%. ""January is clearly a month when consumers are less motivated to purchase financial products or put money into dubious financial opportunities"" said Neil Hammerton managing director of Email Systems. ""Spammers seem to have adapted their output to reflect this focussing instead on medically motivated and pornographic offers presumably intentionally intended to coincide with what is traditionally considered to be the bleakest month in the calendar"" he said.

0, The current slew of sports games offers unparalleled opportunities for fans who like to emulate on-field action without ever moving from the couch.  The two giants in the field - ESPN and EA Sports - have been locked in a heavyweight battle for years. The latter is the world's largest games manufacturer. Years of experience mean that the titles in their steady flow of sport sims are finely honed massively entertaining and ooze flair. Sports broadcaster ESPN meanwhile has leant its name to a series of games that are similarly classy but lower in profile and price. But that status quo was changed forever - or for the next 15 years at least - by a deal earlier this year when ESPN sold EA the rights to its TV branding and on-air talent meaning the ESPN games presently developed by Sega will have to come to and end in their present form.  It was a massive-money deal that not only raised eyebrows but stirred active indignation in many quarters with fans concerned that it is set to enable EA to monopolise the sports gaming landscape to an unhealthy degree. Some particularly disgruntled fans set up an online petition that notched more than 18000 virtual signatures. Many of those clicking to complain were already rankled for the ESPN coup happened just weeks after EA had pulled off another enormous licensing deal controversially giving them exclusive rights to teams and personnel from America&#191";"s National Football League (NFL). So will the Sega - ESPN range be missed? A key reason for answering ""yes"" is that liking or disliking a sports game regularly comes down to personal taste and having some options available always proves hugely handy. Online soccer fans will testify to that between bouts of arguing over which high-profile title rules supreme out of the similar-yet-hugely-different FIFA 2005 and Pro Evolution Soccer 4. On the same note the ESPN 2k5 and EA sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players' personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements. Taking hockey and basketball as examples both publishers' efforts are phenomenally entertaining and fairly accessible. They also both look awesome with the Sega / ESPN versions perhaps shading things on a graphical front.  In terms of gameplay I marginally preferred EA's NBA Live 2005 for basketball and was more satisfied ice hockey-wise by ESPN's NHL 2K5. The ESPN games are a touch more arcade-like in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into although like their rivals they also offer a dizzyingly-extensive array of in-game tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most die-hard of sports fans. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the ESPN deal will be seeing how it affects the presentation of EA's future titles. The front-end decoration of EA's games has become something of an art-form in itself loaded with slick visuals and oodles of licensed music. They are also immediately identifiable as coming from the EA stable and the inevitable compulsion to add an ESPN look will no doubt change that in various ways. What is a shame is that the ESPN titles took similar care about framing the gameplay with an authentic setting - their preambles look and sound much like they would on TV. They are neat and excellent-value games in their current form and combining them with EA's own established brand should produce a truly formidable beast. ";;

0, British Telecom has said it will double the broadband speeds of most of its home and business customers.  The increased speeds will come at no extra charge and follows a similar move by internet service provider AOL. Many BT customers will now have download speeds of 2Mbps although there are usage allowances of between one gigabyte and 30 gigabytes a month. The new speeds start to come into effect on 17 February for home customers and 1 April for businesses. ""Britain is now broadband Britain"" said Duncan Ingram BT's managing director broadband and internet services. He added: ""Ninety percent of our customers will see real increases in speed.  ""These speed increases will give people the opportunity to do a lot more with their broadband connections"" he said. Upload speeds - the speed at which information is sent from a PC via broadband - will remain at the same speed said Mr Ingram. Despite the increases BT will continue to have usage allowances for home customers. ""The allowances are extremely generous"" said Mr Ingram ""For what we are seeing in the market place - they are really not an issue."" BT will begin enforcing the allowances in the summer. Customers who exceed the amounts will either be able to pay for a bigger allowance or see their download speeds reduced. BT now has a 36% share of the broadband market - down from 39% - which is becoming increasingly competitive. In the last few months many rival ISPs have begun to offer 2Mbps services including AOL Plusnet and UK Online.  But Britain continues to lag behind some countries - especially Japan and South Korea - which offer broadband speeds of up to 40Mbps. But Mr Ingram said it was important to ""separate hype from reality"". He said that a limited number of people with those connections consistently received speeds of 40Mbps. Customers will not see their connections double immediately on 17 February. Mr Ingram said there would be a roll out across the network in order to prevent any problems. ";;;
0, Mobiles are not yet ready to be all-singing all-dancing multimedia devices which will replace portable media players say two reports.  Despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life said Jupiter. A separate study by Gartner has also said real-time TV broadcasts to mobiles is ""unlikely"" in Europe until 2007. Technical issues and standards must be resolved first said the report. Batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer like video playback video messaging megapixel cameras and games amongst others. Bringing music download services based on the success of computer-based download services will put more demands on battery life.  Fifty percent of Europeans said the size of a mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets. ""Mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the PC music experience as the handsets are not yet ready"" said Thomas Husson mobile analyst at Jupiter research. ""Mobile music services should be new and different and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches."" Other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones compared to portable players which can hold up to 40GB of music. The mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading after the success of Apple's iTunes Napster and other net music download services.  With phones getting smarter and more powerful there are also demands to be able to watch TV on the move. In the US services like TiVo To Go let people transfer pre-recorded TV content onto their phones. But the Gartner report on mobile TV broadcasting in Europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait. Currently TV-like services where clips are downloaded are offered by several European operators like Italy's TIM and 3. Mobile TV will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though said the report.  Various standards and ways of getting TV signals to mobiles are being worked on globally. In Europe trials in Berlin and Helsinki are making use of terrestrial TV masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers. A service from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation lets people watch TV programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day. The service uses 3GP technology one of the standards for mobile TV. But at the end of 2004 the European Telecommunications Institute (Etsi) formally adopted Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld (DVB-H) as the mobile TV broadcasting standard for Europe. Operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. The cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed. Handsets also need to be able to work with the DVB-H standard. TV services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital TV generation too which expects good quality images at low prices according to analysts. People are also likely to be put off watching TV on such small screens said Gartner. Digital video recorders like Europe's Sky+ box and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what TV they watch. As a result people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away that control. More powerful smartphones like the XDA II Nokia 6600 SonyEricsson P900 and the Orange E200 offering web access text and multimedia messaging e-mail calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common. A report by analysts InStat/MDR has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by 44% over the next five years.

In its monthly security bulletin it flagged up eight ""critical"" security holes which could leave PCs open to attack if left unpatched. The number of holes considered ""critical"" is more than usual. They affect Windows programs including Internet Explorer (IE) media player and instant messaging. Four other important fixes were also released. These were considered to be less critical however. If not updated either automatically or manually PC users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes. Many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely install programs change and delete or see data.  One of the critical patches Microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some IE flaws. Stephen Toulouse a Microsoft security manager said the flaws were known about and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw he did not rule them out. Often when a critical flaw is announced spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched. A further patch fixes a hole in Media Player Windows Messenger and MSN Messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. Microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in its software every month. The most important ones are those which are classed as ""critical"". Its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker Sybari Software as part of Microsoft's plans to make its own security programs. ";;;
0, Consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency ID (RFID) tags in shops a survey says.  More than half of 2000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses. Some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases. The survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in Europe was low. The survey of consumers in the UK France Germany and the Netherlands was carried out by consultancy group Capgemini. The firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of RFID technology. The tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number.  More than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that RFID tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. Fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that RFID tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. Ard Jan Vetham Capgemini's principal consultant on RFID said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about RFID before it would become accepted technology. ""Acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns. ""With the right RFID approach and ongoing communication with consumers the industry can reach this point."" He said that the survey also showed people would accept RFID if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. The tags are currently being used at one Tesco distribution centre in the UK - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. They are also in use as a passcard for the M6 Toll in the Midlands in the UK. Mr Vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52%) believed that RFID tags could be read from a distance. He said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. At least once consumer group - Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering (Caspian) - has claimed that RFID chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing. All kinds of personal belongings including clothes could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners it warned. ";;;
0, Ask Jeeves has bought the Bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs.  The Bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read search and share all the blogs they are interested in. Ask Jeeves said it was not planning to change Bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. How much Ask Jeeves paid for Bloglines was not revealed.  Bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. To do this it makes use of a technology known as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. The acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. Google acquired Pyra Labs makers of the Blogger software in 2003. In 2004 MSN introduced its own blog system and Yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. Jim Lanzone vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US said it did not acquire Bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. He said Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it.  ""The universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers"" he said. Mr Lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with Ask's My Jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links. ""Search engines are about discovering information for the first time and RSS is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites"" he said. It would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that Ask Jeeves operates. There would be no instant sweeping changes to Bloglines said Mr Lanzone. ""Our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away"" he said. Though Mr Lanzone added that Ask Jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries Bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology. ""Being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right"" said Mr Lanzone. Rumours about the acquisition were broken by the Napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from Ask Jeeves insiders. ";;;
0, Nicholas Negroponte chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (Â£53).  He told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be "" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood"". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a Linux-based operating system ""We have to get the display down to below $20 to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.  ""The second trick is to get rid of the fat  if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory."" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.  While the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. ""We put in 25 laptops three years ago  only one has been broken the kids cherish these things it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine not just a textbook."" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. ""Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years we're talking about months."" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. ""In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That's for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away."" ";;;
0, Mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales according to research from technology analysts Gartner.  More than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally said the report the highest total sold to date. The figure was 30% more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions Gartner said. Good design and the look of a mobile as well as new services such as music downloads could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005 said analysts. Although people were still looking for better replacement phones there was evidence according to Gartner that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales.  ""All the markets grew apart from Japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western Europe"" mobile analyst Carolina Milanesi told the BBC News website. ""Japan is where north America and western European markets can be in a couple of years' time. ""They already have TV music ringtones cameras and all that we can think of on mobiles so people have stopped buying replacement phones.""  But there could be a slight slowdown in sales in European and US markets too according to Gartner as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. This means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade said Gartner. Third generation mobiles (3G) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer like video could drive people into upgrading their phones but Ms Milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen. ""At the end of the day people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don't really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical."" Nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. The majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms.  More likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics as well as music services. The Motorola Razr V3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005 she added. This was not a ""women's thing"" she said but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. It was not just about how the phone functioned but about what it said about its owner. ""Western Europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design"" said Ms Milanesi.  ""People are after something that is nice-looking and together with that there is the entertainment side. ""This year music will have a part to play in this."" The market for full-track music downloads was worth just $20 million (Â£10.5 million) in 2004 but is set to be worth $1.8 billion (Â£9.4 million) by 2009 according to Jupiter Research. Sony Ericsson just released its Walkman branded mobile phone the W800 which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours' battery life and a two megapixel camera. In July last year Motorola and Apple announced a version of iTunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with Motorola mobile phones. Apple said the new iTunes music player would become Motorola's standard music application for its music phones. But the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the iPod. Ms Milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. But they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity which would not put too much strain on battery life. ";;;
0, Yahoo one of the net's most iconic companies is celebrating its 10th anniversary this week.  The web portal has undergone remarkable change since it was set up by Stanford University students David Filo and Jerry Yang in a campus trailer. The students wanted a way of keeping track of their web-based interests. The categories lists they devised soon became popular to hundreds of people and the two saw business potential in their idea.  Originally dubbed ""Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web"" the firm adopted the moniker Yahoo because the founders liked the dictionary definition of a yahoo as a rude unsophisticated uncouth person. The term was popularised by the 18th Century satirist Jonathan Swift in his classic novel Gulliver's Travels. ""We were certainly not sophisticated or civilised"" Mr Yang told reporters ahead of the anniversary which will be officially recognised on 2 March.  They did have business brains however and in April 1995 persuaded venture capitalists Sequoia Capital which also invested in Apple Computer and Cisco Systems to fund Yahoo to the tune of $2m (Â£1.04m). A second round of funding followed in the autumn and the company floated in April 1996 with less than 50 employees. Now the firm employs 7600 workers and insists its dot com culture of ""work hard play hard"" still remains. It is one of just a handful of survivors of the dot-com crash although it now faces intense rivalry from firms such as Google MSN and AOL. Jerry Yang who remains the firm's ""Chief Yahoo"" is proud of what the company has achieved. ""In just one decade the internet has changed the way consumers do just about everything - and it's been a remarkable and wonderful experience"" he said. Through it all we wanted to build products that satisfied our users wants and needs but it's even more than that - it's to help every one of us to discover get more done share and interact."" ";;;
0, At the Mbita Point primary school in western Kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus.  They are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised. It is a pilot project run by EduVision which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up-to-date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. Matthew Herren from EduVision told the BBC programme Go Digital how the non-governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called E-slates. ""The E-slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school. This in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver. The data is transmitted alongside audio signals."" The base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld E-slates. ""It downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it. It also stores this on its hard disc.""  The system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network. But Mr Herren says there are both pros and cons to the project. ""It's very simple to set up just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school but it's also a one-way connection so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult.""  The project is still at the pilot stage and EduVision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the Linux-based system. ""The content is divided into visual information textual information and questions. Users can scroll through these sections independently of each other."" EduVision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content. Mr Herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students. He is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site Google to digitise some of the world's largest university libraries. ""All books in the public domain something like 15 million could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them. Then every rural school in Africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in Oxford and Harvard"" Currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity. But Mr Herren says EduVision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions. ""We plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station have the E-slates charge during the day when the children are in school then they can take them home at night and continue working."" Maciej Sundra who designed the user interface for the E-slates says the project's ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world. ""Why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks? The fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting - as they need it most."" ";;;
0, Firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all UK phone networks.  The rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. The first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. The rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones.  In the last couple of years ringtones wallpapers screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. But fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers said Jeremy Flynn head of third party services at Vodafone.  ""If you are not on the operator's portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it's a problem of how people discover your services"" he said. To combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. This tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them for instance several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. Mr Flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. Websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for. ""What made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently"" said Mr Flynn. ""People did not know they were being offered a subscription service."" ""We saw potential for substantial consumer harm here"" he added.  The swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. The drafting of the new rules was led by the Mobile Entertainment Forum and the UK's phone firms. ""Everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct"" said Andrew Bud regulatory head of the MEF and executive chairman of messaging firm MBlox.  ""It's all about transparency"" he said. ""Consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it."" ""The consumer has a right to be protected"" he said. Christian Harris partnership manager of mobile content firm Zed said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads. ""The groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that's done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out"" he said. The new rules came in to force on 15 January and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. Some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for said Mr Flynn. Also said Mr Flynn Vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules. ""We have quite draconian contracts with firms"" he said. ""We do not have to say why. We can just cut them off."" Under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal ""stop"" command sent via text message. He said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service. ""The mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality"" said Mr Flynn. ";;;
0, Jef Raskin head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer has died.  Mr Raskin was one of the first employees at Apple and made many of the design decisions that made the Mac so distinctive when it was first released. He led the team that decided to use a graphical interface and mouse that let people navigate around the computer by pointing and clicking. The 1984 release of the Mac reflected Mr Raskin's belief that good design should make computers easy to use.  Mr Raskin joined Apple in 1978 as employee number 31 initially to lead the company's publications department. However in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use.  The result was the 1984 Macintosh that did away with the then common text-based interface in favour of one based around graphics that resembled a virtual desktop and used folders and documents. Users navigated around the machine using a mouse and by pointing clicking and dragging. Although now in common use in almost all computers these methods were pioneering when first used in the Macintosh. The GUI was developed by Xerox PARC and used in its Star machine. But the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by Apple in its pioneering Lisa computer. ""His role on the Macintosh was the initiator of the project so it wouldn't be here if it weren't for him"" said Andy Hertzfeld an early Macintosh team member. Although Mr Raskin drove the team that created the Macintosh he did not stay at Apple to see it released. In 1981 he was removed from the project following a dispute with Apple's mercurial boss Steve Jobs. In 1982 Mr Raskin left Apple entirely. The Macintosh was reputedly named after Mr Raskin's favourite apple though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company. After leaving Apple Mr Raskin founded another company called Information Appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers. He was also an accomplished musician played three instruments and conducted San Francisco's Chamber Opera Society. Mr Raskin was diagnosed in December 2004 with pancreatic cancer and died on 26 February at his home in California. ";;;
0, People are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends.  More than 50% of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years. More than half (54%) of those asked in a poll for mobile firm Intervoice said that they do not have another address book. A fifth rely entirely on mobiles. About 80% of UK adults own at least one mobile according to official figures. It is estimated that 53% of over 65s own a mobile according to Intervoice but the figures are higher for those aged between 15 and 34.  Most 15 to 24-year-olds (94%) and 25 to 34-year-olds (92%) own at least one. Nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts' information again if the phone was lost stolen or replaced.  The survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book. Many mobile owners do not bother to make back-ups of their contact details and with people changing their phones once a year on average it becomes a problem. They also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart relying on the mobile phone book instead. ""We're a nation of lazy so-and-sos"" David Noone from Intervoice said. ""We put the numbers in our phones so we can call a friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly can't be bothered to write them down in an old fashioned address book. ""The mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships";" take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart."" One in three women the survey said thought if they lost their phones it would mean they would lose touch with people altogether. Most (62%) said they had no idea what their partner's number was. Mr Noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back-up services on the network itself instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves.  Generally information from Sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software. Sim back-up devices can be bought from phone shops for just a few pounds.  But some operators offer customers free web-based back-up services too. Orange told the BBC News website that those with Orange Smartphones could use the My Phone syncing service which means back-ups of address books and other data are created online. For non-smartphone users a Memory Mate card could be used to back up data on the phone. O2 also offers a free web-based syncing service which works over GPRS and GSM. Neither Vodafone or T-Mobile currently offer a free network service for back-ups but encourage people to use Sim back-up devices. It is thought that about 10000 phones are lost or stolen every month and 50% of total street crime involves a mobile. Mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year. Globally more than 167 million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of 2004 26% more than the previous year according to analysts. It is predicted that there will be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005. ";;
0, Cable firm Telewest is to offer a personal video recorder (PVR) in a set -top box to challenge Sky Plus.  Sky Plus is the market leader in the field of digital video recorders in the UK with 474000 subscribers. PVRs record TV programmes to a hard drive letting viewers pause and rewind live television and effectively ""time shift"" the viewing experience. A number of PVRs incorporating Freeview digital terrestrial TV are also on the market but their success is limited. Telewest's PVR will offer a 160GB hard drive which has storage for up to 80 hours of programmes. The box has three tuners which means viewers can record two channels simultaneously while watching a third channel.  Sky Plus boxes come in two versions - a 20GB version for Â£99 and a 160GB version for Â£399. Sky also charges a Â£10 subscription fee to the service unless viewers have a subscription to one of its premium packages. Telewest has yet to reveal pricing for the new box or if it will be charging a subscription fee for the service.  Eric Tveter president and chief operating officer at Telewest Broadband said: ""We will make our PVR set-top box available later this year putting a stop to missed soaps interrupted films and arguments over which programmes to record."" PVRs and recordable DVD players are set to replace video recorders as the standard method of recording and saving favourite TV programmes. Last year high street retailer Dixons said it was going to stop selling VHS machines in favour of PVRs and recordable DVD machines. Sky has said it aims to have 25% of its subscribers using Sky Plus by 2010 - it is predicting 10 million total subscribers by that date. It currently has 7.4 million subscribers while Telewest provides digital cable to 1.7 million customers. ";;;
0, Video games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom.  With violent titles continuing to top the charts gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn. Recent research by the London Institute of Education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom. ""Games teach life skills such as decision making problem solving"" said Martin Owen at Futurelab. Mr Owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error.  Futurelab is a non-profit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning. Most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but Liverpool-based games firm Lateral Visions saw a gap in the market. ""Learning games were somewhat old-fashioned and we didn't see anyone else doing what we wanted to do"" said Dr Carl Gavin managing director of Lateral Visions. The company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element. The result is Racing Academy a massively multiplayer car racing game which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well.  It is being used by Futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom. ""We are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational"" said Mr Owen. Players will have to understand how a car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in a way that no text book can teach. The game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs before and after racing. Teamwork is essential and a chat area allows students to exchange information and data work collaboratively and review their own performances. This fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to Futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved thinks Mr Owen.  The game has been trialled in two secondary schools in Bristol and feedback from students has been positive. ""Pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other"" said Ben Williamson a researcher at Futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools. Dr Gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers' need for learning outcomes and the children's desire to rise to a challenge. ""Games in the classroom need to support the teacher. It is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge"" he said. Professor Angela MacFarlane based at Bristol University has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms.  Use of games in schools has been patchy she found with Sim City proving the most popular. Traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used so-called edu-tainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun she found in her research. ""It is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies"" she wrote in a paper entitled Games and Learning. 'Lite' versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles - persuading developers to write for the educational market. This would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing. Already there are games on the market such as Civilisation and Age of Empire that have educational elements said Mr Owen. ""Even in Grand Theft Auto it is not just the violence that engages people"" he said. It could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though. ";;;
0, Technology firms and gadget lovers are being urged to think more about the environment when buying and disposing of the latest hi-tech products.  At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month several hi-tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment. Ebay also announced the Rethink project bringing together Intel Apple and IBM among others to promote recycling. The US consumer electronics market is set to grow by over 11% in 2005. But more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient said the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Of particular growing concern is how much energy it takes to recharge portable devices one of the fastest growing markets in technology. The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in 2005 will reach more than $125.73 billion (nearly Â£68 billion).  Ebay's initiative pulls together major technology firms environment groups government agencies and eBay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them. The online auction house thinks that its already-established community of loyal users could be influential. ""We really became aware of the e-waste issue and we saw that our 125 million users can be a powerful force for good"" eBay's David Stern told the BBC News website.  ""We saw the opportunity to meet the additional demand we have on the site for used computers and saw the opportunity too to good some good for the environment."" But it is not just computers that cause a problem for the environment. Teenagers get a new mobile every 11 months adults every 18 months and a 15 million handsets are replaced in total each year. Yet only 15% are actually recycled. This year a predicted two billion people worldwide will own a mobile according to a Deloitte report. Schemes in the US like RIPMobile could help in targeting younger generations with recycling messages. The initiative which was also launched at CES rewards 10 to 28-year-olds for returning unused phones. ""This system allows for the transformation of a drawer full of unused mobile phones into anything from music to clothes to electronics or games"" said Seth Heine from RIPMobile.  One group of students collected 1000 mobiles for recycling in just three months. Mr Heine told the BBC News website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes ""learned behaviour"". Europe is undoubtedly more advanced than the US in terms of recycling awareness and robust ""end of life"" programmes although there is a tide change happening in the rest of the world too. Intel showcased some its motherboards and chips at CES which are entirely lead free.  ""There is more and more awareness on the consumer side but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free"" Intel's Allen Wilson told the BBC News website. ""There is still low-level awareness right now but it is on the rise - the highest level of awareness is in Europe."" A European Union (EU) directive WEEE (Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment) comes into effect in August. It puts the responsibility on electrical manufacturers to recycle items that are returned to them. But developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances. Elements like chromium lead and cadmium - common in consumer electronics goods - will be prohibited in all products in the EU by 2006.  But it is not just about recycling either. The predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too. The biggest culprit according to the EPA is the innocuous power adaptor nicknamed ""energy vampires"". They provide vital juice for billions of mobile phones PDAs (personal digital assistants) digital cameras camcorders and digital music players.  Although there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget. On 1 January new efficiency standards for external power supplies came into effect as part of the European Commission Code of Conduct. But at CES the EPA also unveiled new guidelines for its latest Energy Star initiative which targets external power adapters. These map out the framework for developing better adaptors that can be labelled with an Energy Star logo meaning they are about 35% more efficient. The initiative is a global effort and more manufacturers' adaptors are being brought on board. Most are made in China. About two billion are shipped global every year and about three billion are in use in the US alone. The EPA is already working with several companies which make more than 22% of power supplies on the market. ""We are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat hi-tech devices but also bundle with it a hi-tech efficient power supply"" the EPA's Andrew Fanara said. Initiatives like this are critical"; if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40% of electricity used in US homes said the EPA. ;;
0, People using wireless high-speed net (wi-fi) are being warned about fake hotspots or access points.  The latest threat nicknamed evil twins pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations say Cranfield University experts. Once logged onto an Evil Twin sensitive data can be intercepted. Wi-fi is becoming popular as more devices come with wireless capability. London leads the global wi-fi hotspots league with more than 1000. The number of hotspots is expected to reach 200000 by 2008 according to analysts. ""Users need to be wary of using their wi-fi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature"" said Professor Brian Collins head of information systems at Cranfield University.  ""Users can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wi-fi device has its security measures activated"" he added. BT Openzone which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the UK told the BBC News website that it made every effort to make its wi-fi secure. ""Naturally people may have security concerns"" said Chris Clark chief executive for BT's wireless broadband.  ""But wi-fi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet like broadband or dial-up."" He said BT Openzone as well as others have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot. ""This means that users' personal information and data logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure"" said Mr Clark.  In the vast majority of cases base stations straight out of the box from the manufacturers are automatically set up with the least secure mode possible said Dr Nobles. Cybercriminals who try to glean personal information using the scam jam connections to a legitimate base station by sending a stronger signal near to the wireless client. Anyone with the right gear can find a real hotspot and substitute it with an evil twin. ""Cybercriminals don't have to be that clever to carry out such an attack"" said Dr Phil Nobles a wireless net and cybercrime expert at Cranfield. ""Because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency.""  Although wi-fi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use high-speed net on the move there have been fears over how secure it is. Some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security. A wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a company's computer system. Public wi-fi hotspots offered by companies like BT Openzone and The Cloud are accessible after users sign up and pay for use. But many home and company wi-fi networks are left unprotected and can be ""sniffed out"" and hi-jacked by anyone with the correct equipment. ""BT advises that customers should change all default settings make sure that their security settings on all equipment are configured correctly"" said Mr Clark. ""We also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted."" Dr Nobles is due to speak about wireless cybercrime at the Science Museum's Dana Centre in London on Thursday. ";;;
0, The Chinese net-using population looks set to exceed that of the US in less than three years says a report.  China's net users number 100m but this represents less than 8% of the country's 1.3 billion people. Market analysts Panlogic predicts that net users in China will exceed the 137 million US users of the net by 2008. The report says that the country's culture will mean that Chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations.  Already net use in China has a very different character than in many Western nations said William Makower chief executive of Panlogic. In many Western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work. By contrast in China workplace machines are relatively rare. This combined with the relatively high cost of PCs in China and the time it takes to get phone lines installed helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in China. Only 36% of Chinese homes have telephones according to reports. ""Net usage tends to happen in the evening"" said Mr Makower ""they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf&#233";"."" ""Its fundamentally different usage to what we have here"" he said.  Net use in China was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the country's eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities. The net is key to helping Chinese people keep in touch with friends said Mr Makower. Many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes. What people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of Chinese life. For instance said Mr Makower credit cards are rare in China partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt. ""The most popular way to pay is Cash-On-Delivery"" he said ""and that's quite a brake to the development of e-commerce."" The arrival of foreign banks in China due in 2006 could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare said Mr Makower. But if Chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on Western ways of living. ""A large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar"" he said. ""Generally it's more difficult for the government to be able to control it."" ""Its real value is as an open window onto what's happening elsewhere in the world"" he said. Government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages Chinese people would not see anywhere else. Familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet. ""It's a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it"" said Mr Makower. ";;
0, The first convictions for piracy over peer-to-peer networks have been handed down in the US.  New Yorker William Trowbridge and Texan Michael Chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music movies and software. The two men faced charges following raids in August on suspected pirates by the FBI. The pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250000 (Â£130000) fine.  In a statement the US Department of Justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the Direct Connect peer-to-peer network. The piracy group called itself the Underground Network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. Direct Connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers. Users would swap files such as films and music by exchanging data over the network. During its investigation FBI agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies 40 software programs 13 games and 178 ""sound recordings"" from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. The raids were organised under the umbrella of Operation Digital Gridlock which was aimed at fighting ""criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks"". In total six raids were carried out in August. Five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm. The Department of Justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement. They also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage. The two men are due to be sentenced on 29 April. ";;;
0, The net search giant Google has launched a search service that lets people look for TV programmes.  The service Google Video beta searches closed caption information that comes with programmes. It only searches US channel content currently. Results list programmes with still images and text from the point where the search phrase was spoken. It should expand over time to include content from more channels said a Google spokesperson. The first version of the service is part of Google's expanding efforts to be a ubiquitous search engine for people to find what they want on the web and beyond. ""We think TV is a big part of people's lives"" said Jonathan Rosenberg Google's vice president of product management. ""Ultimately we would like to have all TV programming indexed.""  Google Video has been indexing US-based programmes from PBS the NBA Fox News and C-SPAN since December. But there were few clues from Google about when more global broadcasters would be included. ""Over time we plan to increase the number of television channels and video content available via Google Video but don't have more product details to share with you today"" a Google spokesperson told the BBC News website.  The results thrown up by the search will also include programme and episode information like channel date and time. It also lets people find the next time and channel where a programme will aired locally using a US zip code search function. Rival search engine Yahoo has been developing a similar type of video search for webcasts and TV clips which it promotes from its homepage. It offers direct links to websites with movies or other clips relevant to the search query but does not pinpoint when the search query occurred. A spokeswoman told the Financial Times on Monday that Yahoo was adding captioning for Bloomberg BBC and BSkyB broadcasts. A smaller service blinkx.tv was launched last month. It searches for and links to TV news film trailers and other video and audio clips. ";;;
0, Viruses trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change.  The shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash steal valuable data or take over home PCs. Viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer. Instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code.  The growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs. Before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines. But many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package.  ""You cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to"" said Pete Simpson head of the threat laboratory at security firm Clearswift. Now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments. ""It's about outright criminality now"" said Mr Simpson explaining why this change has come about. He said many of the criminal programs came from Eastern Europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order. Former virus writer Marek Strihavka aka Benny from the 29A virus writing group recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers phishing gangs and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology. No longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors. Not least said Paul King principal security consultant at Cisco because the defences against such attacks are so common. ""In many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now"" he said. Few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data. ""If you think of criminals they do not do clever"" said Mr King ""they just do what works.""  As the tactics used by malicious programs change said Mr King so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves. Now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network.  Many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded. As well as using different tactics criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent. ""The main motivation now is money"" said Gary Stowell spokesman for St Bernard software. Mr Stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high. With almost any phishing or spyware attack criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover. So-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites. In some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on PCs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine. ";;;
0, Americans are becoming avid blog readers with 32 million getting hooked in 2004 according to new research.  The survey conducted by the Pew Internet and American Life Project showed that blog readership has shot up by 58% in the last year. Some of this growth is attributable to political blogs written and read during the US presidential campaign. Despite the explosive growth more than 60% of online Americans have still never heard of blogs the survey found. Blogs or web logs are online spaces in which people can publish their thoughts opinions or spread news events in their own words. Companies such as Google and Microsoft provide users with the tools to publish their own blogs.  The rise of blogs has spawned a new desire for immediate news and information with six million Americans now using RSS aggregators. RSS aggregators are downloaded to PCs and are programmed to subscribe to feeds from blogs news sites and other websites. The aggregators automatically compile the latest information published online from the blogs or news sites. Reading blogs remains far more popular than writing them the survey found. Only 7% of the 120 million US adults who use the internet had created a blog or web-based diary. Getting involved is becoming more popular though with 12% saying they had posted material or comments on other people's blogs.  Just under one in 10 of the US's internet users read political blogs such as the Daily Kos or Instapundit during the US presidential campaign. Kerry voters were slightly more likely to read them than Bush voters. Blog creators were likely to be young well-educated net-savvy males with good incomes and college educations the survey found. This was also true of the average blog reader although the survey found there was a greater than average growth in blog readership among women and those in minorities. The survey was conducted during November and involved telephone surveys of 1324 internet users. ";;;
0, Software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a PC but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing has been unveiled.  Worries about cyber-crime and sabotage have prompted many employers to consider monitoring employees. The developers behind the system claim it is a break-through in the way data is monitored and stored. But privacy advocates are concerned by the invasive nature of such software.  The system is a joint venture between security firm 3ami and storage specialists BridgeHead Software. They have joined forces to create a system which can monitor computer activity store it and retrieve disputed files within minutes. More and more firms are finding themselves in deep water as a result of data misuse. Sabotage and data theft are most commonly committed from within an organisation according to the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) A survey conducted on its behalf by NOP found evidence that more than 80% of medium and large companies have been victims of some form of cyber-crime. BridgeHead Software has come up with techniques to prove to a legal standard that any stored file on a PC has not been tampered with. Ironically the impetus for developing the system came as a result of the Freedom of Information Act which requires companies to store all data for a certain amount of time.  The storage system has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm 3ami which allows every action on a computer to be logged. Potentially it could help employers to follow the trail of stolen files and pinpoint whether they had been emailed to a third party copied printed deleted or saved to CD floppy disk memory stick or flash card. Other activities the system can monitor include the downloading of pornography the use of racist or bullying language or the copying of applications for personal use. Increasingly organisations that handle sensitive data such as governments are using biometric log-ins such as fingerprinting to provide conclusive proof of who was using a particular machine at any given time. Privacy advocates are concerned that monitoring at work is not only damaging to employee's privacy but also to the relationship between employers and their staff. ""That is not the case"" said Tim Ellsmore managing director of 3ami. ""It is not about replacing dialogue but there are issues that you can talk through but you still need proof"" he said. ""People need to recognise that you are using a PC as a representative of a company and that employers have a legal requirement to store data"" he added. ";;;
0, A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions.  The draft law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned at a Brussels meeting on Monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. ""There was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. But in the end we could not put it on"" an EU spokesman told the Reuters agency. He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law.  In December Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. Its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. Poland is a large EU member so its backing for the legislation is vital. The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. In the US the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its ""one-click shopping"" service. Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing. ";;;
0, Internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated suggests a report into search habits.  The report by the US Pew Research Center reveals that 87% of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine. It also shows that few can spot the difference between paid-for results and organic ones. The report reveals that 84% of net users say they regularly use Google Ask Jeeves MSN and Yahoo when online.  Almost 50% of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden. According to figures gathered by the Pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 1.9 webpages for each hunt. A significant chunk of net users 36% carry out a search at least weekly and 29% of those asked only look every few weeks. For 44% of those questioned the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find.  Search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it. According to Pew Research 44% of searchers use just a single search engine 48% use two or three and a small number 7% consult more than three sites. Tony Macklin spokesman for Ask Jeeves said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query. Despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes. A small number 17% said they wouldn't really miss search engines if they did not exist. The remaining 33% said they could not live without search sites. More than two-thirds of those questioned 68% said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net. Alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid-for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web. Of those asked 62% were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search. Only 18% of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not. Said the Pew report: ""This finding is ironic since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results."" Commenting Mr Macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference. ";;;
0, UK video game firms face a testing time as they prepare for the next round of games consoles the industry warns.  Fred Hasson head of Tiga which represents independent developers said that more UK firms would go under due to greater risks in making new titles. Three leading UK video game companies also predicted that more firms would close as they struggled to adapt. Microsoft Sony and Nintendo are expected to release new consoles in the next 18 months. Microsoft has said repeatedly that it wants to be first to the market and some analysts predict that Xbox 2 will be released in the US before the end of 2005.  The new machines will all have much greater processing and graphical power which will have a huge impact on development of next generation games. Mr Hasson said: ""In the last four years we have probably lost a third of independent developers."" He said there were about 150 independent developers left in the industry and more were likely to close. ""Once the cull has finished its likely to present those still standing with great opportunities"" he said.  Mr Hasson said the industry was predicting that developments costs and teams were likely to need to double in order to cope with the demands of the new machines. That figure was endorsed by three independent companies contacted by the BBC News website - Codemasters Climax and Rebellion.  ""As consoles get more powerful the content gets more detailed and that means more cost"" said Gary Dunn development director at Codemasters which develops games in house and also publishes titles. Jason Kingsley chief executive of Rebellion said the transition from the current generation of consoles to the new machines was difficult because ""the production quality expected by consumers will be that much bigger"". He added: ""We have been through five technology transitions and survived so far. ""Each one has involved the death of some people. All companies said they were investing in new tools - called middleware - in order to try and avoid staff numbers spiralling out of control.  Simon Gardner president of Climax's Action studio said: ""We are investing in superior tools and editors. We are investing upfront to generate this content without the need for huge teams. ""It's vital we avoid huge teams."" He said Climax was already directing about 20% of its resources to preparation for next generation titles. Mr Dunn warned that companies could face a short supply of programming development and artistic talent. ""If companies are hiring bigger and bigger teams at some point the talent is going to run out."" Mr Hasson said games developers were beginning to realise that they had to be more ""business-like"". ""There are still some developers who were involved in games from the bedroom coding days. ""Some of them are still making games for peer group approval - that has to stop."" ";;;
0, Microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its Windows operating system by restricting their access to security features.  The Windows Genuine Advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid-2005. It will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates but their options would be ""limited"". Microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect PCs. Either PCs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through Microsoft's site. Those running pirated Windows programs would not have access to other downloads and ""add-ons"" that the software giant offers.  People who try to manually download security patches will have to let Microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number.  Microsoft's regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms viruses and other threats penetrating PCs. Some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats with more PCs left unprotected. But Graham Cluley senior consultant at security firm Sophos told the BBC News website that it was a positive decision. ""It sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of Windows is good news for everyone who uses the net"" he said. Windows Genuine Advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in September 2004 for English-language versions of Windows.  Microsoft's Windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. The company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. Software piracy has cost the company billions it says. The company announced earlier in January that it was releasing security tools to clean up PCs harbouring viruses and spyware which 90% of PCs are infected with. The virus-fighting program updated monthly is a precursor to Microsoft's dedicated anti-virus software. Last year it introduced the Windows XP Counterfeit Project a UK-based pilot scheme which ran from November to December. The scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in PCs bought before November could replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones for free. It is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in China Norway and the Czech Republic where pirated software is a huge problem by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies Windows. ""China in particular is a problem with piracy estimated at 92%"" said Mr Cluley. ";;;
0, Nintendo's new handheld console the DS will launch in Europe on 11 March the company has announced.  The portable games machine which features touch-screen control will retail for Â£99 in the UK (149 euros). Nintendo said 15 games would be available in the UK at launch with prices ranging from Â£19 to Â£29. More than 2.8 million DS consoles have been sold since it first appeared in the US and Japan at the end of 2004. Rival Sony has said it will launch its first handheld console the PSP in the US and Europe before the end of March. The PSP is expected to compete for a large part of the same handheld market despite Sony's assertion that the machines are aimed at different consumers.  The 15 games available on the European launch date will include Nintendo's Super Mario 64 DS as well as titles from third-party developers such as Ubisoft's Rayman DS.  More than 120 games are in development for the new console Nintendo has said. The DS is backwards compatible with the Game Boy Advance allowing the earlier machine's back catalogue of 700 games to be played. Additionally a short-range wireless link for multiplayer gaming is built in to the DS with a ""download play"" option which allows a group to play against each other even if just one person owns a copy. Other features include a short-range messaging application called Pictochat and a built-in microphone which is used in Sega's launch title Project Rub. Nintendo has also announced a media adapter which will allow the console to play music and video on the move.  The launch price of Â£99 (149 euros) compares favourably with the US price of $149 according to John Houlihan editor of the Computerandvideogames.com magazine. ""It's a very very competitive price point. There are some innovative features and Nintendo has created quite a buzz"" he says. ""However the line-up of games could have been stronger. Everyone wanted to see the eight-player Mario Kart DS for example.""  Mr Houlihan believes that there is likely to be an audience for both the Nintendo DS and Sony's new PSP with the former aimed largely at a younger audience and the latter expected to be marketed as a multimedia device. ""The PSP is a sexy bit of kit but Sony's attitude to the PSP has been very understated in Europe so far"" Mr Houlihan said. The worldwide handheld software market had an estimated worth of $2.6bn at the end of 2004 according to industry analysts Screen Digest.  In the past games consoles and handhelds have generally launched much later in Europe than in other parts of the world. However Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said the company was ""pleased to have offered such a short period of time between the US and European launch"". ""Europe is an extremely important market for Nintendo"" Mr Iwata added. Nintendo raised its sales targets for the DS console last December after selling a million in the US and Japan in just a few weeks. ";;;
0, If you don't know art but know what you like new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting.  ArtGarden developed by BT's research unit is being tested by the Tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings. Rather than search by the name of an artist or painting users are shown a selection of pictures. Clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works.  The technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection. It 'chooses' a selection of pictures by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them. So for instance a Whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and Whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement 19th century and water. A variety of paintings will then be shown to the user based partly on the keywords and partly on luck. ""It is much more akin to wandering through the gallery"" said Jemima Rellie head of the Tate's digital programme. For Richard Tateson who worked on the ArtGarden project the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration. ""I went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for Christmas but I didn't have a clue what I wanted"" he said. The text-based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer neither of which he found helpful. He ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead.  He thinks the dominance of text-based searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers. Similarly with art browsing is often more important than finding a particular object. ""You don't arrive at Tate Britain and tell people what you want to see. One of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they wouldn't have asked for"" he said. The Tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as ArtGarden can help with that said Ms Rellie. She hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future. BT research is looking at extending the technology to other searching such as for music and films. ";;;
0, Writing a Microsoft Word document can be a dangerous business according to document security firm Workshare.  Up to 75% of all business documents contained sensitive information most firms would not want exposed a survey by the firm revealed. To make matters worse 90% of those companies questioned had no idea that confidential information was leaking. The report warns firms to do a better job of policing documents as corporate compliance becomes more binding.  Sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers said Andrew Pearson European boss of Workshare which commissioned the research. ""The efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too"" he said. The problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using Microsoft Word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes. As documents get passed around worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents. Poor control over the editing and amending process can mean that information that should be expunged survives final edits. Microsoft however does provide an add-on tool for Windows PCs that fixes the problem. ""The Remove Hidden Data add-in is a tool that you can use to remove personal or hidden data that might not be immediately apparent when you view the document in your Microsoft Office application"" says the instructions on Microsoft's website. Microsoft recommends that the tool is used before people publish any Word document. A tool for Apple machines running Word is not available. Workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that on average 31% of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to three-quarters fell in to the high risk category. Often said Mr Pearson this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared.  However the way that Windows works means that earlier versions can be recalled and reconstructed by those keen to see how a document has evolved. Few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this so-called metadata about the changes that a document has gone through or that it can be reconstructed. The discovery of this hidden information could prove embarrassing for companies if for instance those tendering for contracts found out about the changes to terms of a deal being negotiated. The research revealed that a document's metadata could be substantial as on average only 40% of contributors' changes to a document make it to the final draft. Problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite said Mr Pearson. ";;;
0, The blurring of boundaries between TV and the internet raises questions of regulation watchdog Ofcom has said.  Content on TV and the internet is set to move closer this year as TV-quality video online becomes a norm. At a debate in Westminster the net industry considered the options. Lord Currie chairman of super-regulator Ofcom told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog. Despite having no remit for the regulation of net content disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by Ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option. At the debate organised by the Internet Service Providers' Association (ISPA) Lord Currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation.  ""The challenge will arise when boundaries between TV and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves"" he said. Adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate TV content or self-regulation which is currently the practice of the net industry will be up for discussion.  Some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the UK could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005 and the technology opens the door to TV content delivered over the net. More and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web. BT has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as BSkyB ITV and the BBC. Head of the division Andrew Burke spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms. ""How risque can I be in this new age? With celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners surely I can push it to the limit"" he said.  In fact he said if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it then maybe it should be entirely regulation free. Internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the Law Commission dubbed them ""mere conduits"" back in 2002. This defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it. The level of responsibility they have has been tested in several high-profile legal cases. Richard Ayers portal director at Tiscali said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible. Huge changes are afoot in 2005 he predicted as companies such as the BBC offer TV content over the net. The BBC's planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as EastEnders and Top Gear will make net TV mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions he said.  One of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee said Mr Ayers. As inappropriate net content most obviously pornography viewed by children continues to dominate the headlines internet regulation remains a political issue said MP Richard Allan Liberal Democrat spokesman on IT. Mr Allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of ""impossible to regulate"" and ""just apply offline laws online"". In fact instead of seeing regulation brought online the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all TV content. After Lord Currie departed the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign. ""If content is on-demand consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them then it is the consumers' choice to watch it. There is no watershed on the net"" said Mr Burke. ";;;
0, Voting is under way for the annual Bloggies which recognise the best web blogs - online spaces where people publish their thoughts - of the year.  Nominations were announced on Sunday but traffic to the official site was so heavy that the website was temporarily closed because of too many visitors. Weblogs have been nominated in 30 categories from the top regional blog to the best-kept-secret blog. Blogs had a huge year with a top US dictionary naming ""blog"" word of 2004. Technorati a blog search engine tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12000 are added daily. A blog is created every 5.8 seconds according to US research think-tank Pew Internet and American Life but less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months.  Nikolai Nolan who has run the Bloggies for the past five years told the BBC News website he was not too surprised by the amount of voters who crowded the site. ""The awards always get a lot of traffic";" this was just my first year on a server with a bandwidth limit so I had to guess how much I'd need"" he said. There were many new finalists this year he added and a few that had won Bloggies before. Several entries reflected specific news events. ""There are four nominations for the South-East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog which is a pretty timely one for 2005"" said Mr Nolan.  The big Bloggies battle will be for the ultimate prize of blog of the year. The nominated blogs are wide-ranging covering what is in the news to quirky sites of interest. Fighting it out for the coveted award are Gawker This Fish Needs a Bicycle Wonkette Boing Boing and Gothamist. In a sign that blogs are playing an increasingly key part in spreading news and current affairs The South-East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog is also nominated in the best overall category. GreenFairyDotcom Londonist Hicksdesign PlasticBag and London Underground Tube Blog are the nominees in the best British or Irish weblog.  Included in the other categories is best ""meme"". This is for the top ""replicating idea that spread about weblogs"". Nominations include Flickr a web photo album which lets people upload tag share and publish their images to blogs. Podcasting has also made an appearance in the category. It is an increasingly popular idea that makes use of RSS (really simple syndication) and audio technology to let people easily make their own radio shows and distribute them automatically onto portable devices.  Many are done by those who already have text-based blogs so they are almost like audio blogs. Three new categories have been added to the list this year including best food best entertainment and best writing of a weblog. One of the categories that was scrapped though was best music blog. The winners of the fifth annual Bloggies are chosen by the public. Public voting closes on 3 February and the winners will be announced sometime between 13 and 15 March. ";;
0, Net browser Opera 8.0 due for official release at the end of next month will be ""the most accessible browser on the market"" according to its authors.  The latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features based on IBM technology are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create ""style sheets"" its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. ""Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone"" said Opera spokeswoman Berit Hanson. ""So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.""  Another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.  The company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. ""Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural"" said Ms Hanson. ""People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard so this makes the web a more hands-free experience."" Unlike commercially available voice recognition software Opera does not have to be ""trained"" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms. ";;;
0, Spin the radio dial in the US and you are likely to find plenty of Spanish-language music. But what you will not find is much Spanish-language hip-hop.  Hip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the Spanish-speaking world but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. But now a US company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. Los Caballeros de Plan G are one of Mexico's hottest hip-hop acts. They have a devoted fan base in their native Monterrey. But most Mexican hip-hop fans not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio.  ""You can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it's just not accessible"" says Manuel Millan a native of San Diego California. ""It's really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. You usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world."" Millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G accessible to fans globally.  Mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. So Millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. The name says it all: it is web-based radio devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. The site which is in both in English and Spanish is meant to be easy to navigate. All the user has to do is download a media player. There are no DJs. It is just music streamed over the net for free. Suddenly with the help of the website Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing ""export quality"" rap.  The web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. The genre is in what Millan calls its ""infant stage"". But the production values are improving and artists such as Argentina's Mustafa Yoda are pushing to make it better and better. Mustafa Yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. ""He's considered the Eminem of Argentina and the Latin American hip-hop scene"" Millan says. ""He really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world."" Currently the Chilean group Makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10 as is Cuban artist Papo Record. ""Every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs"" Millan says. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now Mexico leads the way accounting for about 50% of listeners. But web surfers in Spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station's traffic comes from there. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. That might be changing though as more and more Latin American artists are finding audiences.  But one Spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. His name is Tote King and Manuel Millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in Spain. On his track Uno Contra Veinte Emcees or One Against 20 Emcees Tote King shows he is well aware of that fact. ""It's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in Spain right now"" Millan says. ""And it's pretty much true. He has the tightest productions and his rap flow is impeccable it's amazing."" Latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap.  Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production. ";;;
0, The body that represents the US movie industry has released its latest tool in its campaign to clamp down on movie file-sharing aimed at parents.  The Movie Association for America's (MPAA) free Parent File Scan software lets parents check their children's computers for peer-to-peer programs. It will also list all movie and music files they have on their hard drive. Parents then have the choice to remove programs and files. The MPAA said files found would not be passed on to it. ""Our ultimate goal is to help consumers locate the resources and information they need to make appropriate decisions about using and trading illegal files"" said Dan Glickman MPAA chief. ""Many parents are concerned about what their children have downloaded and where they've downloaded it from.""  But some computer users who had tested the latest software reported on some technology sites that the program had identified Windows default wav files as copyrighted material and wanted to delete them. Movie piracy cost the industry Â£3.7bn ($7bn) in 2003 according to analysts. The MPAA said in a statement that it would continue to provide easy access to similar tools in the coming months to combat ""the deleterious effects of peer-to-peer software including such common problems as viruses Trojan horses and identity theft"".  Mr Glickman said that the film industry was embracing ""digital age technologies"" like Movielink and CinemaNow which are legal movie sites. ""But legal services such as these need a chance to grow and thrive without having to compete against illegitimate operations that depend on stolen property to survive"" he added. The industry body also said it had launched a second round of legal action against online movie-swappers across the US but did not say how many were being sued. Its first set of lawsuits were filed in November 2004. It also started a campaign against operators of BitTorrent eDonkey and DirectConnect peer-to-peer networks. The first convictions for peer-to-peer piracy were handed out in the US in January. William Trowbridge and Michael Chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music movies and software. ";;;
0, A Norwegian student who ran a website which linked to downloadable MP3 files has been ordered to pay compensation by the country's Supreme Court.  Frank Allan Bruvik was ordered to pay 100000 kroner (Â£8000) to the music industry in Norway. He was a student when he set up his napster.no site which allowed users to submit and receive links to MP3 files. Bruvik had earlier been cleared on appeal after a lower court had found for the music industry. Music industry bosses in Norway said the ruling would help build confidence in the internet as a distribution medium.  Frank Allan Bruvik set up the napster.no website as part of a school project in 2001 while studying computer engineering in the Norwegian town of Lillehammer. The website was not associated with the napster.com site in the USA which had been operating since 1999 and was already facing legal action.  Bruvik's site was online between August and November 2001 and while it did not host any music at its peak it was providing links to more than 170 free files on other servers. As well as providing links the site allowed those visiting it to submit links that could later be accessed by other visitors. A legal complaint for copyright violation was filed by groups including Norway's performing rights society Tono and the Norwegian branches of Sony Music and Universal Music who saw it as an important test of principle.  A Norwegian court ruled in 2003 that Bruvik would have to pay 100000 kroner to the music industry but the country's Court of Appeal cleared him saying that the copyright violation occurred when others posted the music. However the Supreme Court stated that the music was clearly published in violation of copyright law It added that the case was decided based on the responsibility for abetting an illegal act and that Bruvik's actions were premeditated. Norway's music industry said it was satisfied with the ruling because showed that music piracy would not be accepted.  Meanwhile in the USA a further 717 lawsuits against people alleged to have traded copyrighted songs were filed this week by the Recording Industry Association of America. The suits brought on behalf of the major record companies cite the individuals for illegally distributing music via unauthorized peer-to-peer services such as KaZaa and eDonkey. As with preceding cases the fresh action was made against so-called ""John Doe"" defendants who are identified only by the codes given to their computers' internet connections. ";;;
0, If you are a geek or gadget fan the next 12 months look like they are going to be a lot of fun.  The relentless pace of development in the hi-tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors particularly among mobile phone firms all suggests that 2005 is going to be a very good year. To begin with 2005 will be the year that third-generation (3G) mobile phones become inescapable. The 3 network launched in 2003 Vodafone launched its consumer service in November Orange followed in early December and T-Mobile and O2 are due to launch in 2005. The main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up.  Already the extra capacity in 3G networks lets 3 offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators. But the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue. ""Show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them and I'll write their obituary"" said Niel Ransom chief technology officer at Alcatel.  Instead operators are likely to push all other things that 3G phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities. Already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi-megapixel devices go on sale. But 3G will not have everything its own way. It will face competition from emerging technologies such as Wimax. This wireless technology can boost data transmission speeds up to 75 megabits per second and works over distances of up to 30 miles. Kent is likely to be the site of the UK's first Wimax network which is due to go live in 2005 and it could be the way that rural areas get high-speed net access. Analyst firm Telecom View predicts that Wimax will steal a lot of market share from 3G and will be a clear winner. Bob Larribeau principal analyst at Telecom View said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as Wimax could dent the possible returns of 3G networks. And the growing ubiquity of wi-fi must not be forgotten either. The technology is popping up in more places than ever and its wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers.  Moves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in 2005 too.  For a start BT looks set to roll out its Bluephone project during the next 12 months. The service revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home. Fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of Voice over IP (Voip). Voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network. Anyone with a broadband connection which is now more than 50% of the UK's net using population can use Voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it. Telecommunications regulator Ofcom has declared 056 to be the area code for Voip calls and 2005 is likely to see a lot more consumer-focused Voip call services starting up. Home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition. If 2004 has been the year of the portable music player they 2005 looks like it will be the year of the portable media player. Motorola has just announced a deal with Apple to produce a phone that works with the iTunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace. The pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet. Some of those devices will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had. Convergence could mean that single-function devices start to dwindle in number. Instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want. The only downside is that consumers will face a series of tough choices as they are confronted by a bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities. But that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with. ";;;
0, First it was the humble home video then it was the DVD and now Hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition.  High-definition gives incredible 3D-like pictures and surround sound. The DVD disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out. But when high-definition films do come out on the new format DVDs it will profoundly change home entertainment. For Rick Dean director of business development for digital content company THX a high-definition future is an exciting prospect. He has worked on the Star Wars DVD trilogy Finding Nemo The Incredibles and Indiana Jones. ""There was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds"" he told the BBC News website.  ""The technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined. ""The film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master"" he says. But currently putting a master feature film onto DVD requires severe compression because current DVD technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand. ""As much as you compress the picture data rate wise you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master"" he explains. ""I would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and I find it very exciting.""  High-definition DVDs can hold up to six times more data than the DVDs we are used to. It will take time though to persuade people who spent money on DVD players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition DVDs in 18 months' time. Mr Dean is confident though: ""I think if they see real HD [high-definition] not some heavily compressed version of it there is such a remarkable difference. ""I have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen.""  High-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too. On the whole producing films for high-definition DVDs will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed. Equally it may mean Hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average DVD. ""When we master movies right now our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second"" says Mr Dean. ""Our DVDs that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second. ""That's a huge amount of compression that has to be applied - about 98%. So if you have anything that allows more space you don't have to compress so hard."" Studios could fit a lot more marketing material games and features onto high-capacity DVDs. Currently an entire DVD project can take up to three months says Mr Dean. Although the step of down-converting will be bypassed this will realistically only save a day's work says Mr Dean. One of the most time consuming elements is building DVD navigation and menu systems. On the fairly complex Star Wars disks making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone. If studios want to cash in on the extra space it could mean extra human hours for which someone has to pay. ""If the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required."" And if studios do focus on delivering more ""added value content"" thinks Mr Dean ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it. Those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition DVD. But if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price studios will listen thinks Mr Dean.  High-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and DVD production alike. More clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous. ""When we did the first HD version of Star Wars Episode I everybody was very sun-tanned but that was make-up. ""In the HD version of Episode I all these make-up lines showed up"" explains Mr Dean. The restoration of the older Star Wars episodes revealed some interesting items too.  ""There are scans of a corridor [on the Death Star] and fairly plainly in one of those shots there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways. ""You never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn't see it."" What high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur. With home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas this line blurs even further. It could also mean that how we get films and in what format will widen. ""In the future we are going to look towards file delivery over IP [internet protocol - broadband] giving a DVD-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive"" says Mr Dean. But that is some time off for most and for now people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves. ";;;
0, News website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing. A brief round-up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below.  If you think of Snake when some mentions ""mobile games"" then you could be in for a bit of a surprise. This is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time. Even before Nokia's N-Gage game phone launched in late 2003 many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset.  And given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the GameBoy it could be a very lucrative market. That audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can. Life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed. Now sites such as Wireless Gaming Review list more than 200 different titles for some UK networks and the ranges suit every possible taste. There are ports of PC and arcade classics such as Space Invaders Lunar Lander and Bejewelled. There are also versions of titles such as Colin McRae Rally that you typically find on PCs and consoles.  There are shoot-em-ups adventure games strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets. Rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in. Increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads. The returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost Â£5. What has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as Wap push. By sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset. Far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals. The number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too. Almost half of all phones now have Java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available - even the ones that use 3D graphics.  The minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too. Now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option. The processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too. Some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile. Many titles particularly racing games let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others. Usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a ""ghost"" or ""shadow"" to see if you can beat them. A few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or if you are sitting close to them via Bluetooth short-range radio technology. With so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening. But these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing.   TOO FAST TOO FURIOUS (DIGITAL BRIDGES)   As soon as I start playing this I remember why I never play driving games - because I'm rubbish at them. No matter if I drive the car via joystick or keypad I just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers. The game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit. Winning gives you cash for upgrades. Graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background. The cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track. The only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play.   FATAL FORCE (MACROSPACE)   A futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading Earth. Graphics are a bit cartoon-like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring. Both background music and sounds effects work well. The scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the Fatal Force commanders. Weapons include flamethrowers rocket launchers grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while. With the right power-up you can go into a Matrix-style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens. The game lets you play via Bluetooth if others are in range. Online the game has quite a following with clans player rankings and even new downloadable maps. ";;;
0, The makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home PCs could face hefty fines in California.  From 1 January a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware. The legislation which was approved by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information. Spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing PC users in the coming year. The software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information. At its worst it has the ability to hijack personal data like passwords login details and credit card numbers. The programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate.  One form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer user's web-surfing. It can result in people being bombarded with pop-up ads that are hard to close. In Washington Congress has been debating four anti-spyware bills but California is a step ahead. The state's Consumer Protection Against Spyware Act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer. It also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware. Consumers are able to seek up to $1000 in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software. The new law marks a continuing trend in California towards tougher privacy rights. A recent survey by Earthlink and Webroot found that 90% of PCs are infested with the surreptitious software and that on average each one is harbouring 28 separate spyware programs. Currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as Spybot and Ad-Aware. ";;;
0, The web is helping aid agencies gather resources to help cope with the aftermath of the tsunami disaster.  Many people are making donations via websites or going online to see how they can get involved with aid efforts. High-profile web portals such as Google Yahoo Ebay and Amazon are gathering links that lead people to aid and relief organisations. So many were visiting some aid-related sites that some webpages were struggling to cope with the traffic. An umbrella organisation called the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) has been set up by a coalition of 12 charities and has been taking many donations via its specially created website. It urged people to go online where possible to help because donations could be processed more quickly than cash donated in other ways meaning aid could be delivered as quickly as possible. The site has so far received almost Â£8 million with more than 11000 donations being made online every hour.  Telco BT stepped in to take over the secure payments on the DEC site and provided extra logistical support for phone and online appeals after it was initially crippled with online donations. It has also provided space in London's BT tower for one of the call centres dealing with donations.  Some of the web's biggest firms are also helping to channel help by modifying their homepages to include links to aid agencies and organisations collecting resources. On its famously sparse homepage Google has placed a link that leads users to a list of sites where donations can be made. Among the 17 organisations listed are Oxfam Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) and Network for Good. Many of the sites that Google lists are also taking online donations. Online retailer Amazon has put a large message on its start page that lets people donate money directly to the American Red Cross that will be used with relief efforts. Auction site eBay is giving a list of sites that people can either donate directly to divert a portion of their profits from anything they sell on eBay to the listed organisations or simply buy items that direct cash to those in the list. Yahoo is proving links direct to charities for those that want to donate. The Auction Drop website is asking people to donate old digital cameras computers and other gadgets they no longer want that can be auction to raise cash for the aid effort. Sadly the outpouring of goodwill has also encouraged some conmen to try to cash in. Anti-fraud organisations are warning about e-mails that are starting to circulate which try to convince people to send money directly to them rather than make donations via aid agencies. Those wanting to give cash were urged to use legitimate websites of charities and aid agencies. ";;;
0, Mobile phones in the UK are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend.  Britain's first mobile phone call was made across the Vodafone network on 1 January 1985 by veteran comedian Ernie Wise. In the 20 years since that day mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of Britons own a handset. Mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline.  The first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in New York but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched. The UK was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked. The first call was made from St Katherine's dock to Vodafone's head office in Newbury which at the time was over a curry house. For the first nine days of 1985 Vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the UK. Then on 10 January Cellnet (now O2) launched its service. Mike Caudwell spokesman for Vodafone said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase cost about Â£2000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes.  ""Despite that they were hugely popular in the mid-80s"" he said. ""They became a yuppy must-have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk."" This was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on. He said it took Vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million. ""It's very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people"" he said. ""Cellnet was forecasting half that."" Now Vodafone has 14m customers in the UK alone. Cellnet and Vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the UK until 1993 when One2One (now T-Mobile) was launched. Orange had its UK launch in 1994. Both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology. The analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired. Called Global System for Mobiles (GSM) this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 1.2 billion people make calls. Mr Caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular. ";;;
0, Web logs or blogs are everywhere with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow.  These online diaries come in many shapes and styles ranging from people willing to sharing their views pictures and links to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. But this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. Most blogs may have only a small readership but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. The most well-known examples include Iraqi Salam Pax's accounts of the US-led war former Iranian vice-president Mohammad Ali Abtahi exclusive insight into the Islamic Republic's government and the highs and lows of the recent US election campaign. There are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs like wikinews.com launched last November.  The blogging movement has been building up for many years.  Andrew Nachison Director of the Media Center a US-based think-tank that studies media technology and society highlights the US presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. ""You could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before"" he says. ""And blogs were a key part of that transformation."" Among them were blogs carrying picture messages saying ""we are sorry"" for George W Bush's victory and the responses from his supporters. Mr Nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers TV and radio. ""We have to acknowledge that in all of these cases mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas"" he told the BBC News website. ""But they followed the story they didn't lead it.""  Some parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs.  Others like the French newspaper Le Monde have applied a different strategy offering blogs as part of its content. ""I don't think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. It is in transition as society itself is in transition"" says Mr Nachison. However he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst Noam Chomsky that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper. ""The one-to-many road of traditional journalism yes it is threatened. And professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse"" says Mr Nachison. ""The notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what's acceptable for public consumption and what isn't that's gone forever."" ""With people now walking around with information devices in their pockets like camera or video phones we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories.""  It seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger.  But the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing in a web already overloaded with information. Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence the so-called blogosphere has already exceeded five million and is growing at exponential levels. Tools such as Google's Blogger MovableType and the recently launched beta version of MSN Spaces are making it easier to run a blog. US research think-tank Pew Internet & American Life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. But experts agree that the phenomenon allowing individuals to publish share ideas exchange information comment on current issues post images or video on the web easily is here to stay. ""We are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other"" said Mr Nachison. ""And there's going to be bad that comes with the good."" ";;;
0, Leading British computer games maker Peter Molyneux has been made an OBE in the New Year Honours list.  The head of Surrey's Lionhead Studios was granted the honour for services to the computer games industry. Mr Molyneux has been behind many of the ground-breaking games of the last 15 years such as Populous Theme Park Dungeon Keeper and Black and White. He is widely credited with helping to create and popularise the so-called god-game genre.  Speaking to the BBC News website Mr Molyneux said receiving the honour was something of a surprise. It's come completely out of the blue"" he said ""I never would have guessed that I'd have that kind of honour."" He said he was surprised as much because not too long ago many people thought computer gaming was a fad.  ""It was thought to be like skateboarding"" he said ""a craze that everyone thought would go away."" Now he said the gaming world rivals the movie industry for sales and cultural influence. ""Britain plays a big part in it"" he said. ""It's one of the founding nations that made the industry what it is."" Mr Molyneux has been a pivotal figure in the computer games industry for almost 20 years. His career started at Bullfrog Studios which in 1987 produced Populous one of the first God-games. The title gave players control over the lives a small population of computerised people. Mr Molyneux said that his involvement with the games industry started almost by accident as back in the early days game making was more a hobby than a career. ""I thought everyone would treat Populous as weird"" he said ""but it became a huge international success."" He left Bullfrog in 1997 to set up Lionhead Studios which was behind the ambitous and widely acclaimed game Black & White. One of the next titles to come from Lionhead puts players in charge of a movie studio and tasks them with producing and directing a hit film. The veteran game maker says he has one problem still to solve. ""Being an absolute geek I've got no idea what I'm going to wear when I go and pick it up"" he said. ";;;
0, Surfers outside the US have been unable to visit the official re-election site of President George W Bush.  The blocking of browsers sited outside the US began in the early hours of Monday morning. Since then people outside the US trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it. The blocking does not appear to be due to an attack by vandals or malicious hackers but as a result of a policy decision by the Bush camp.  The international exclusion zone around georgewbush.com was spotted by net monitoring firm Netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites. Netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 October attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in London Amsterdam and Sydney failed.  By contrast Netcraft's four monitoring stations in the US managed to view the site with no problems. The site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the US. Some web users in Canada also report that they can browse the site. The pattern of traffic to the website suggests that the blocking was not due to an attack by vandals or politically motivated hackers. Geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis. On 21 October the George W Bush website began using the services of a company called Akamai to ensure that the pages videos and other content on its site reaches visitors. Mike Prettejohn president of Netcraft speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs and traffic in the run-up to the election on 2 November. He said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week. Managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign. However simply blocking non-US visitors also means that Americans overseas are barred too. Akamai declined to comment saying it could not talk about customer websites. ";;;
0, A US airline attendant is fighting for her job after she was suspended over postings on her blog or online diary.  Queen of the Sky otherwise known as Ellen Simonetti evolved into an anonymous semi-fictional account of life in the sky. But after she posted pictures of herself in uniform Delta Airlines suspended her indefinitely without pay. Ms Simonetti was told her suspension was a result of ""inappropriate"" images. Delta Airlines declined to comment.  ""I was really shocked I had no warning"" Ms Simonetti told BBC News Online. ""I never thought I would get in trouble because of the blog. I thought if they had a problem someone would have said something before taking action."" The issue has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest employment law and free speech on personal websites. Ms Simonetti was suspended on 25 September pending an investigation and has since lodged a complaint with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). A spokesperson for Delta Airlines told BBC News Online: ""All I can tell you is we do not discuss internal employee issues with the media."" She added she could not say whether a similar situation over personal websites had occurred in the past.  Ms Simonetti started her personal blog in January to help her get over her mother's death. She had ensured she made no mention of which airline she worked for and created fictional names for cities and companies. The airline's name was changed to Anonymous Airline and the city in which she was based was called Quirksville. A large part of the blog contained fictional stories because Queen of the Sky developed over the months as a character in her own right according to Ms Simonetti.  The images were taken from a digital camera she had inherited from her mother. ""We often take pictures on flight or on layovers. I just though why not include them on my blog for fun. ""I never meant it as something to harm my company and don't understand how they think it did harm them"" Ms Simonetti said. She has also claimed that pictures of male Delta Airline employees in uniform are freely available on the web. Of the 10 or so images on the site only one showed Ms Simonetti's flight ""wings"". ""They did not tell me which pictures they had a problem with. I am just assuming it was the one of me posing on seats where my skirt rode up"" she said. The images were removed as soon as she learned she had been suspended. As far as Ms Simonetti knows there is no company anti-blogging policy. There is guidance which suggests the company uniform cannot be used without approval from management but use in personal pictures on websites is unclear.  Jeffrey Matsuura director of the law and technology programme at the University of Dayton said personal websites can be hazardous for both employers and their employees. ""There are many examples of employees who have presented some kind of material online that have gotten them in trouble with employers"" he said. It was crucial that any policy about what was and what was not acceptable was expressed clearly was reasonable and enforced fairly in company policy. ""You have to remember that as an employee you don't have total free speech anymore"" he said. Mr Matsuura added that some companies actively encouraged employees to blog. ""One of the areas where it does become a problem is that they encourage this when it suits them but they may not be particularly clear when they [employees] do cross the line."" He speculated that Delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images of Ms Simonetti in uniform were posted. ""Whether or not that is successful will depend on what exactly is prohibited and whether you can reasonably say this content now crosses that line"" he said. Ms Simonetti said her suspension has caused two of her friends to discontinue their blogs. One of them was asked to stop blogging by his company before any action was taken. ""If they had asked me just take down the blog I would have done it but that was not been given to me as an option"" she said. ""This blogging thing is obviously a new problem for employers and they need to get a policy about it. If I had known it would cost me my job I would not have done that."" ";;;
0, Four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in Europe by the end of 2004 than last year says a report from analysts Gartner.  Globally the number sold will reach 159 million an increase of 104%. The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly ""must-have"" buy. In Europe cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. But in Japan and Asia Pacific where camera phone technology is much more advanced mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Japan still dominates mobile phone technology and the uptake there is huge. By 2008 according to Gartner 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.  Camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This has changed in the last 18 months. Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways they have introduced more design features like rotating screens and viewfinders removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.  Mobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites or mobile blogs - moblogs. But the report suggests that until image quality increases more people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005 it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions like nightclubs. Other developments include wide-angle modes basic editing features and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.  Images from camera phones have even made it into the art world. An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.  The exhibition Fonetography will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey Rankin and Nan Goldin and artists Sir Peter Blake Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some uses for them have worried many organisations. Intel Samsung the UK's Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. Many schools fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. Italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. According to recent figures Sony Ericsson's profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras it said. ";;;
0, Computer games could enhance learning and have a legitimate place in the classroom say researchers.  Academics from the Institute of Education at London University found that ""games literacy"" was a key skill for youngsters. As well as being used in different areas of the curriculum games are a legitimate area of study in their own right researchers say. Pupils should also be able to create their own games they say.  ""Like all games computer and video games entertain while promoting social development and playing and talking about games is an important part of young people's lives"" said project manager Caroline Pelletier.  ""Games literacy is a way of investigating how games are means of expression and representation just like writing or drawing"" she said. The researchers conducted two studies into the impact of games on education the first looking at how they can be used in different curriculum subjects to enhance learning. Researchers found that girls were often excluded from the male-dominated world of game playing. ""Without first-hand experience of how much fun a game can be they have little motivation to play and remain disengaged from an engrossing and sociable activity"" said research fellow Diane Carr.  The second project looked at how games can be integrated into media education and concluded that writing games should be a core part of studying them. Sixth-form teacher Barney Oram already teaches computer games alongside the more traditional study of film TV and popular music at the A-level course he runs at Long Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge.  For parents the idea that computer games could be brought into the classroom environment could cause controversy. Dr Andrew Burn associate director of the Institute of Education's Centre for the Study of Children Youth and Media moved to reassure anxious parents. ""Games are a legitimate cultural form that deserve critical analysis in schools just as film television and literature do"" he said. ""But we also want to argue that full understanding only comes when children have the tools to create their own games."" The games industry welcomed the report saying it showed how games had a positive impact on children. ""At a time of hysterical and inaccurate reporting it is heartening to see the cultural social and educational value of computer and video games being assessed intelligently"" said Roger Bennett director general of the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association. ""This report is further evidence if it were needed about the excellence and imagination that thrives in gaming. They have much to offer to the education of our children and they have much to offer as a career."" The three-year research project which is being presented at a seminar on Tuesday in London was partly funded by the Department of Trade and Industry. ";;;
0, The computer systems used to monitor the world's nuclear power installations are so outdated that they are hampering the work of inspectors.  A spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said its current technology could allow key information to be overlooked as it was more than 20 years old. Such systems are the only method of tracking nuclear material worldwide. The agency has appealed for more funds to update its hardware and software. ""A major overhaul of the system is needed to allow inspectors immediate secure online access to information"" said project manager Livio Costantini.  IAEA inspectors make around 3000 visits a year to more than 900 nuclear facilities worldwide. They are there to verify official reports of activities in the plants to carry out environmental checks and also to look for any signs that nuclear material is being smuggled in or out of the facility.  The computer system inspectors currently use for comparing data from earlier visits for instance was built in the 1970s and largely paper based. An IAEA spokesman said this was extremely inefficient and makes searching for anomalies like searching for a needle in a haystack. The organisation is aiming to start a system upgrade in November aiming to provide inspectors in the field with secure online access to previous inspection data design blueprints of nuclear facilities even satellite images of the plant. Where possible it hopes to link the system with national records of the import and export of nuclear materials. Further analysis of these could help spot potential smuggling activities or illicit technology transfers between countries according to a spokesman.  Computer specialist at the IAEA Peter Smith would like to be able to incorporate state of the art visualisation techniques more familiar to video games players into the inspector's toolkit. ""The commercials you now see have people are moving around in a virtual world"" he said. ""If we could have that on our laptops we could be walking through the plant seeing on the laptop how the plant should look. ""And if there's a door in the wall that is not on our laptop then we have a problem."" The IAEA estimates the total cost of the four-year project to upgrade its technology will be $40m. So far it has only received $11m from the US and the UK. ""Failure to replace the hardware and software and to integrate fully all the information system components will carry large risks"" said an agency statement. ";;;
0, Some of the most vivid descriptions of the devastation in southern Asia are on the internet - in the form of web logs or blogs.  Bloggers have been offering snapshots of information from around the region and are also providing some useful information for those who want to help. Indian writer Rohit Gupta edits a group blog called Dogs without Borders. When he created it the site was supposed to be a forum to discuss relations between India and Pakistan. But in the wake of Sunday's tsunami Mr Gupta and his fellow bloggers switched gears.  They wanted to blog the tsunami and its aftermath. One Sri Lankan blogger in the group goes by the online name Morquendi. With internet service disrupted by the tsunami Morquendi started sending SMS text messages via cell phone from the affected areas of Sri Lanka. ""We started publishing these SMSes"" says Mr Gupta.  ""Morquendi was describing scenes like 1600 bodies washed up on a shore and people burying and burying and burying them. People digging holes with their hands. And this was coming through an SMS message. ""We didn't have visual accounts on radio or on TV or in the print media."" Soon thousands of web users around the world were logging on to read Morquendi's first hand accounts. In one message Morquendi wrote about a Sri Lankan woman who was running home with a friend when the wave hit. ""She was being swept away"" Morquendi's message read. ""She grabbed a tree with one hand and her friend with the other. She says she watched the water pull her friend away."" Mr Gupta says the power of Morquendi's text message blogs was palpable. ""He was running around looking for friends burying bodies carrying bodies"" Mr Gupta says of Morquendi. ""I can't even begin to imagine the psychological state he was in when he was sending us reports and doing the relief work at the same time. ""He was caught between being a journalist and being a human being.""  Others blogs are helping to spread information about relief efforts. Dina Mehta is an Indian blogger who's helping with the newly created South East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog. She says the blog is not meant to be filled with first person accounts. ""What we're doing is we're building a resource"" she says. ""Anyone who says OK I want to come and do some work in India volunteer in India or in Sri Lanka or Malaysia this is the sort of one-stop-shop that they can come to for all sorts of resources - emergency help lines relief agencies aid agencies contacts for them etc.""  Ms Mehta also says she wishes that governments in the region would realise the power of blogs. ""Imagine if they had this resource available to them if there was a disaster how quickly you could funnel aid in and get people to help"" she says. Bloggers in the United States are also getting involved. Ramdhan Yadav Kotamaraja is originally from India but now lives in Dallas. Mr Kotamaraja wanted to help those affected by the tsunami by pooling money with concerned friends. So he set up an online payment system on his website. Then says Mr Kotamaraja the blogging world found out. ""All my blogger friends started linking up my site and I saw a lot of people other than my friends. I'd say 70% of the donations came from people I don't know. ""It's simply unbelievable to me that people that I don't know will come and start donating."" News spreads quickly on weblogs a phenomenon that helps bloggers expand their audience and scope. In Sri Lanka blogger Morquendi is recruiting others to help. One recruit calls himself Heretic. In one of his latest posts Heretic asks: ""Have you ever seen fishing trawlers on the road? Ever seen a bus inside a house? ""Well"" Heretic writes ""that was just the least affected areas - so you can just imagine - or can you?"" He concludes: ""Keep it blogged.""

0, The world's dwindling panda population is getting a helping hand from a wireless internet network.  The Wolong Nature Reserve in the Sichuan Province of southwest China is home to 20% of the remaining 1500 giant pandas in the world. A broadband and wireless network installed on the reserve has allowed staff to chronicle the pandas' daily activities. The data and images can be shared with colleagues around the world. The reserve conducts vital research on both panda breeding and bamboo ecology.  Using the network vets have been able to observe how infant pandas feed and suggest changes to improve the tiny cubs' chances of survival.  ""Digital technology has transformed the way we communicate and share information inside Wolong and with the rest of the world"" said Zhang Hemin director of the Wolong Nature Reserve. ""Our researchers now have state-of-the-art digital technology to help foster the panda population and manage our precious surroundings."" The network has been developed by Intel working closely with the staff at Wolong. It includes a 802.11b wireless network and a video monitoring system using five cameras to observe pandas around the clock.  Before the new infrastructure arrived at the panda park staff walked or drove to deliver floppy disks across the reserve. Infant panda health was recorded on paper notebooks and research teams in the field had little access to the data. To foster cultural links across the globe a children's learning lab has been incorporated in the network in collaboration with Globio (Federation for Global Biodiversity Education for Children) an international non-profit organisation. It will enable children at local primary schools to hook up with their peers in Portland Oregon in the US. ""Digital technology brings this story to life by enabling a global dialogue to help bridge cultures around the world"" said Globio founder Gerry Ellis. ";;;
0, Another front in the on-going battle between Microsoft and Google is about to be opened.  By the end of 2004 Microsoft aims to launch search software to find any kind of file on a PC hard drive. The move is in answer to Google's release of its own search tool that catalogues data on desktop PCs. The desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded as Google AOL Yahoo and many smaller firms tout programs that help people find files.  Microsoft made the announcement about its forthcoming search software during a call to financial analysts to talk about its first quarter results. John Connors Microsoft's chief financial officer said a test version of its desktop search software should be available for download by the end of the year.  ""We're going to have a heck of a great race in search between Google Microsoft and Yahoo"" he said. ""It's going to be really fun to follow."" Microsoft is coming late to the desktop search arena and its software will have to compare favourably with programs from a large number of rivals many of which have fiercely dedicated populations of users. The program could be based on the software Microsoft owns as a result of its purchase of Lookout Software in early October. On 14 October Google released desktop search software that catalogues all the files on a PC and lets users use one tool to find e-mail messages spreadsheets text files and presentations. The software will also find webpages and messages sent via AOL Instant Messenger.  Many other firms have released desktop search systems recently too. Companies such as Blinkx Copernic Enfish X1 Technologies and X-Friend all do the same job of cataloguing the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer.  Apple has also debuted a similar search system for its computers called Spotlight that is due to debut with the release of the Tiger operating system. Due to follow are net giants AOL and Yahoo. The latter recently bought Stata Labs to get its hands on search software that people can use. Microsoft is also reputedly working on a novel search system for the next version of Windows (codenamed Longhorn). However this is not likely to appear until 2006. ""The recent activity in the search industry shows that there is a need to move beyond simple keyword-based web search"" said Kathy Rittweger co-founder of Blinkx. ""Finding information of our own computers is becoming as difficult as it is to find the relevant webpage amongst the billions that exist.""  Desktop search has become important for several reasons. According to research by message analysts the Radicati Group up to 45% of the information critical to keeping many businesses running sits in e-mail messages and attachments. JF Sullivan spokesman for e-mail software firm Sendmail said many organisations were starting to realise how important messaging was to their organisation and the way the work. ""The key thing is being able to manage all this information"" he said. Also search is increasingly key to the way that people get around the internet. Many people use a search engine as the first page they go to when getting on the net. Many others use desktop toolbars that let them search for information no matter what other program they are using. Having a tool on a desktop can be a lucrative way to control where people go online. For companies such as Google which relies on revenue from adverts this knowledge about what people are looking for is worth huge amounts of money. But this invasiveness has already led some to ask about the privacy implications of such tools. ";;;
0, The fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species.  Research by handset maker Nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take. According to the study more than 45 million people in the UK Germany US and South Korea now only use a mobile. It showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile.  The Nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes. Home phones were used for longer calls but conversations on mobiles tended to be shorter between mobiles and to friends. In the UK 69% of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile. However when pressed few could say with accuracy how tariffs on fixed and mobile phones compared. In the US and Germany many of those interviewed said they used the fixed phone because it was more reliable than a mobile handset and let them get access to the net at relatively high speeds. In all the countries where interviews were carried out older people were more likely to use a fixed line phone more than a mobile. Women aged 50 or above almost never use a mobile phone the research found.  The move to mobile was most pronounced in South Korea where 65% of those questioned said they already make most of their calls from a mobile. 18% said they would not get a landline if they moved house.  Many of those questioned said they had an emotional connection to their fixed phone that drew on its position in the home and the ""cosiness"" of making a call there. Nokia said these findings had implications for mobile operators who must work hard to ensure that mobiles are seen as cheap reliable and providing good call quality. The survey also showed that it is not just voice calls that are going wireless. Some of those questioned said they were looking to use a mobile or wireless service to get net access within the next couple of years. Polling firm Mori interviewed more than 6000 people in the UK US Germany and South Korea for the survey. ";;;
0, An Apple iPod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10000 songs which is a lot of space to fill.  But more and more iPod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. It is called ""podcasting"" and its strongest proponent is former MTV host and VJ (video jockey) Adam Curry. Podcasting takes its name from the Apple iPod although you do not need an iPod to create one or to listen to a podcast. A podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create usually in the comfort of their own home. They need only a microphone a PC and some editing software. They then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them all for free. Using technology based on XML computer code and RSS - Really Simple Syndication - listeners can subscribe to podcasts collected automatically in a bit of software which Mr Curry has pioneered. The latest MP3 files of shows can then be picked up by a music playing device automatically.  Mr Curry records hosts edits and produce a daily 40 minute podcast called The Daily Source Code. He wants to make podcasting ""the Next Big Thing"" and says it is an extension of his childhood love of radio gadgetry. ""I was always into technologies and wires"" he explains. ""My parents gave me the Radio Shack 101 project kit which allows you to build an AM transmitter and subsequently an FM transmitter. ""I had my mom drive me around the block see how far it would reach on the car radio.""  Mr Curry is American but he grew up in the Netherlands where he hosted illegal pirate radio shows in the Dutch capital. He tried university in the US and ended up back in Holland where he hosted a music video show. He spent the next seven years in New York where he worked at MTV hosting the Top 20 Video Countdown but spent most of his hours tinkering with this new thing called the internet. ""At a certain point in 1995 I was driving in on a Friday afternoon beautiful blue sky one of those beautiful days thinking this is so stupid. ""You know I'm going do the Top 20 Countdown take the cheque go home and sit on the internet until three in the morning. ""So after I finished the show I quit. I said on air it's been great I've been here for seven years at that point there's something on the internet I've got to go find it and I'll see you later.""  But Mr Curry's technology and broadcast interests started to gel a couple of years ago when computer storage was growing exponentially and high-speed internet connections were becoming more widely available. The MP3 format also meant that people could create and upload audio more cheaply and efficiently than ever before.  Most importantly Mr Curry says people across the globe were bored with the radio they were hearing. ""Listen to 99% of the radio that you hear today it's radio voices and it's fake it's just fake."" He wanted to make it easier for people to find ""real voices"" on the internet. He wanted software that would automatically download new audio content directly onto players like iPods. Mr Curry is not a computer programmer so he asked others to create one for him. No one did so he tried to write one himself. He finished it a few months ago and says it ""totally sucked."" He put it up on the net as open source software and now dozens of coders and audio junkies are refining it";" the result is a work in progress called ""ipodder"". Doug Kaye a California-based podcaster praises the former MTV VJ for what he has done. ""Adam created a simple script that solved what we call the last mile problem. Ipodder takes audio from the web and brings it all the way down to the MP3 player"" he explains. ""People can wake up in the morning pick up their iPods as they go to work or before they go exercise and discover that there's all this new content automatically put onto their players."" It is created an explosion in podcasting content and podcasters are springing up in Australia Finland Brazil even Malaysia. One couple broadcasts theirs The Dawn and Drew Show from Wisconsin in the US sometimes even from the comfort of their own bed. Topics range from the comfort of their bed to the latest films or music and have thousands of listeners.  Already websites are springing up that point listeners in the right direction of good podcasts.  Chris McIntyre runs Podcast Alley and says that there are good sites out there but that not everyone has the technological know-how to simply listen. ""If I were to tell my mom or my mother-in-law to copy an XML or RSS file to their podcast aggregator they would think I was speaking a foreign language"" Mr McIntyre says. Along with technical challenges there may be legal challenges to podcasters who air their favourite albeit copyrighted music. Some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the ""anti-radio"" into something that is more like conventional broadcasting. Already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world. Heineken is doing its own podcast now and so is Playboy. For his part Adam Curry's pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be. He loves doing The Daily Source Code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences. He has even been called the Ed Sullivan or Johnny Carson of podcasting which he says ""is a badge I'll wear with great honour. ""To be the Johnny Carson or Ed Sullivan of anything is wonderful. And you know what? You don't need a hell of a lot of talent. ""You just have to be nice have your ears open and let people shine. And that's good for me.""

1, Shares in Elan and Biogen Idec plunged on Monday as the firms suspended sales of new multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri after a patient's death in the US.  On the New York Stock Exchange shares in Ireland-based Elan lost 70% while US partner Biogen Idec shed 43%. The firms took action after the death from a central nervous system disease and a suspected case of the condition. The cases cited involved the use of both Tysabri and Avonex Biogen Idec's existing multiple sclerosis drug. The companies said they have no reports of the rare condition - progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) - in patients taking either Tysabri or Avonex alone. Tysabri was approved for use in the US last November and was widely tipped to become the world's leading multiple sclerosis treatment.  ""The companies will work with clinical investigators to evaluate Tysabri-treated patients and will consult with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of PML"" the two firms said in a statement. ""The outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine possible re-initiation of dosing in clinical trials and future commercial availability.""  Analysts had believed the product would provide a new growth opportunity for Biogen Idec which had faced increased competition from rivals to Avonex. Elan once the biggest firm on the Irish stock exchange was also expected to receive a boost from the new product. An inquiry into Elan's accounts in 2002 brought the group close to bankruptcy but the firm has been rebuilding itself since with its share price increasing by almost four-fold last year. ""Most of the value in the company was in Tysabri"" said Ian Hunter at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin. ""Now there's a question mark over it."" Elan finished down $18.90 at $8 while Biogen fell $28.63 to $38.65.  - Shares in UK pharmaceutical firm Phytopharm closed down 19.84% at 151.5 pence on the London Stock Exchange on Monday after it said a partner was set to pull out of a deal on an experimental Alzheimer's disease treatment. Phytopharm said Japan's Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical was likely to end a licensing agreement prompting analysts to raise questions over the level of its future cash reserves. ";;;
1, The decision to keep interest rates on hold at 4.75% earlier this month was passed 8-1 by the Bank of England's rate-setting body minutes have shown.  One member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) - Paul Tucker - voted to raise rates to 5%. The news surprised some analysts who had expected the latest minutes to show another unanimous decision. Worries over growth rates and consumer spending were behind the decision to freeze rates the minutes showed. The Bank's latest inflation report released last week had noted that the main reason inflation might fall was weaker consumer spending.  However MPC member Paul Tucker voted for a quarter point rise in interest rates to 5%. He argued that economic growth was picking up and that the equity credit and housing markets had been stronger than expected.  The Bank's minutes said that risks to the inflation forecast were ""sufficiently to the downside"" to keep rates on hold at its latest meeting. However the minutes added: ""Some members noted that an increase might be warranted in due course if the economy evolved in line with the central projection"". Ross Walker UK economist at Royal Bank of Scotland said he was surprised that a dissenting vote had been made so soon. He said the minutes appeared to be ""trying to get the market to focus on the possibility of a rise in rates"". ""If the economy pans out as they expect then they are probably going to have to hike rates."" However he added any rate increase is not likely to happen until later this year with MPC members likely to look for a more sustainable pick up in consumer spending before acting. ";;;
1, Cold weather across parts of the United States and much of Europe has pushed US crude oil prices above $50 a barrel for the first time in almost three months.  Freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall have increased demand for heating fuel in the US where stocks are low. Fresh falls in the value of the dollar helped carry prices above the $50 mark for the first time since November. A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 to $51.15 in New York on Tuesday. Opec members said on Tuesday that it saw no reason to cut its output.  Although below last year's peak of $55.67 a barrel which was reached in October prices are now well above 2004's average of $41.48.  Brent crude also rose in London trading adding $1.89 to $48.62 at the close. Much of western Europe and the north east of America has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days. The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices. ""The dollar moved sharply overnight and oil is following it"" said Chris Furness senior market strategist at 4Cast. ""If the dollar continues to weaken oil will be obviously higher.""  Several Opec members said a cut in production was unlikely citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia. ""I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this"" Fathi Bin Shatwan Libya's oil minister told Reuters. ""I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel"" he added. Opec closely watches global stocks to ensure that there is not an excessive supply in the market. The arrival of spring in the northern hemisphere will focus attention on stockpiles of US crude and gasoline which are up to 9% higher than at this time last year. Heavy stockpiles could help force prices lower when demand eases. ";;;
1, Prices of homes in the UK rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in February says the Nationwide building society.  The figure means the annual rate of increase in the UK is down to 10.2% the lowest rate since June 2001. The annual rate has halved since August last year as interest rises have cooled the housing market. At the same time the number of mortgage approvals fell in January to a near 10-year low official Bank of England figures have shown.  Nationwide said that in January house prices went up by 0.4% on the month and by 12.6% on a year earlier. ""We are not seeing the market collapsing in the way some had feared"" said Nationwide economist Alex Bannister. There have been a number of warnings that the UK housing market may be heading for a downturn after four years of strong growth to 2004. In November Barclays which owns former building society the Woolwich forecast an 8% fall in property prices in 2005 followed by further declines in 2006 and 2007. And last summer economists at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) warned house prices were overvalued and could fall by between 10% and 15% by 2009.  The price of an average UK property now stands at Â£152879. Homeowners now expect house prices to rise by 1% over the next six months Mr Bannister said. He said if the growth continued at this level then the Bank of England may increase interest rates from their current 4.75%.  ""I think the key is what the Bank expects to happen to the housing market. We always thought we would see a small rise they thought they would see a small decline."" House prices have risen 0.9% this year Nationwide said and if this pace of increase persists prices would rise by just under 6% in the year to December. This is slightly above the 0-5% range Nationwide predicts.  Further evidence of a slowdown in the housing market emerged from Bank of England lending figures released on Tuesday. New mortgage loans in January fell to 79000 from 82000 in December the bank said. The past few months have seen approvals fall to levels last seen in 1995. The Bank revealed that 48000 fewer mortgages were approved in January than for the same month in 2004. Overall mortgage lending rose by Â£7.2bn in January marginally up on the Â£7.1bn rise in December. ";;;
1, Chancellor Gordon Brown has been given a Â£2.1bn boost in his attempts to meet his golden economic rule which allows him to borrow only for investment.  The extra leeway came after the Office for National Statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years. It comes just weeks ahead of the Budget and an expected general election. Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: ""At best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government.""  A review by the ONS found it had made a mistake by ""double counting"" some spending on roads since 1998/9. Correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment thus helping Mr Brown to meet his ""golden rule"" of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle. Economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote-catching measures in the Budget.  The changes by the ONS increase the current budget measure for the past five years by Â£2.1bn in total. Mr Letwin said: ""This is a very murky area... There will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled."" The Conservatives also said Mr Brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual Â£10.5bn ""black hole"" in the nation's coffers. But the Treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions.  In January the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Mr Brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year's Budget. It also said the government might narrowly miss its ""golden rule"" if the current economic cycle ended in 2005/06. After the ONS announcement economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004/05 of about Â£400m. ""None of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years"" said Jonathan Loynes chief UK economist at Capital Economics. ""Accordingly it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course."" ";;;
1, US retail giant Federated Department Stores is to buy rival May Department Stores for $11bn (Â£5.7bn).  The deal will bring together famous stores like Macy's Bloomingdale's and Marshall Field's creating the largest department store chain in the US. The combined firm will operate about 1000 stores across the US with combined annual sales of $30bn. The two companies facing competition from the likes of Wal-Mart tried to merge two years ago but talks failed. Sources familiar with the deal said that negotiations between the two companies sped up after May's chairman and chief executive Gene Kahn resigned in January. As part of the deal Federated - owner of Macy's and Bloomingdale's - will assume $6bn of May's debt bringing the deal's total value to $17bn. Directors at both companies have approved the deal and it is expected to conclude by the third quarter of this year.  May has struggled to compete against larger department store groups such as Federated and other retailers such as Wal-Mart. Federated expects the merger to boost earnings from 2007 but the deal will cost it $1bn in one-off charges.  ""We have taken the first step toward combining two of the best department store companies in America creating a new retail company with truly national scope and presence"" said Terry Lundgren Federated's chairman. Some analysts see the merger as a rescue deal for May. ""Without this deal May would have been to put it bluntly washed up"" said Kurt Barnard president of Barnard's Retail Consulting Group. Federated has annual sales of $15.6bn while May's yearly sales are $14.4bn. ";;;
1, Japanese industry is growing faster than expected boosting hopes that the country's retreat back into recession is over.  Industrial output rose 2.1% - adjusted for the time of year - in January from a month earlier. At the same time retail sales picked up faster than at any time since 1997. The news sent Tokyo shares to an eight-month high as investors hoped for a recovery from the three quarters of contraction seen from April 2004 on. The Nikkei 225 index ended the day up 0.7% at 11740.60 points with the yen strengthening 0.7% against the dollar to 104.53 yen. Weaker exports normally the engine for Japan's economy in the face of weak domestic demand had helped trigger a 0.1% contraction in the final three months of last year after two previous quarters of shrinking GDP. Only an exceptionally strong performance in the early months of 2004 kept the year as a whole from showing a decline. The output figures brought a cautiously optimistic response from economic officials. ""Overall I see a low risk of the economy falling into serious recession"" said Bank of Japan chief Toshihiko Fukui despite warning that other indicators - such as the growth numbers - had been worrying.  Within the overall industrial output figure there were signs of a pullback from the export slowdown. Among the best-performing sectors were key overseas sales areas such as cars chemicals and electronic goods. With US growth doing better than expected the picture for exports in early 2005 could also be one of sustained demand. Electronics were also one of the keys to the improved domestic market with products such as flat-screen TVs in high demand during January. ";;;
1, A close associate of former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky has told a court that fraud charges levelled against him are ""false"".  Platon Lebedev has been on trial alongside Mr Khodorkovsky since June in a case centring around the privatisation of a fertiliser firm. The pair claim they are being punished by the authorities for the political ambitions of Mr Khodorkovsky. Mr Lebedev said there were ""absurd contradictions"" in the case. Opening his defence he said he could not see the legal basis of the charges he faced which also include allegations of tax evasion. ""To my embarrassment I could not understand the file of complaints against me"" he told a Moscow court. Mr Lebedev headed the Menatep group the parent company of Yukos.  Mr Lebedev and Mr Khodorkovsky who each face a possible 10 year jail sentence if convicted will be questioned by a judge over the next few days. Mr Khodorkovsky began his testimony last week telling the court that he objected to the way that the ""running of a normal business has been presented as a work of criminal fiction"". The charges are seen by supporters as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in the country's super-rich business leaders the so-called oligarchs. Yukos has been presented with a $27.5bn (Â£13bn) tax demand by the Russian authorities and its key Yugansk division was auctioned off to part settle the bill. The company's effort to gain bankruptcy protection in the US - in a bid to win damages for the sale - were dismissed by a court in Texas. ";;;
1, Shell has signed a $6bn (Â£3.12bn) deal with the Middle Eastern sheikhdom of Qatar to supply liquid natural gas (LNG) to North America and Europe.  The UK-Dutch group will own 30% of the project with Qatar's state oil firm owning the rest. The agreement is the latest in a string of deals reached by Qatar which is trying to make itself a regional leader in natural gas. US oil giant ExxonMobil signed up for a $12.8bn deal earlier on Sunday. France's Total is expected to join the ExxonMobil scheme dubbed Qatargas-2 on Monday taking 5 million tonnes of LNG a year. ExxonMobil will be taking some 15 million tonnes each year for 25 years from the end of 2007 under the deal. Shell's agreement under the name Qatargas-4 foresees the building of new facilities to handle 1.4 billion cubic feet of gas and 7.8 million tonnes of LNG each year from 2011 onwards. ";;;
1, India is to boost spending on primary schools and health in a budget flagged as a boost for the ordinary citizen.  India's defence budget has also been raised 7.8% to 830bn rupees ($19bn). The priority for Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram is to fight poverty and keep the government's Communist allies onside. But his options are limited by a new law which makes him cut the budget deficit which he said would be 4.5% of GDP in the year to March 2005. The country's overall deficit is thought to be more than 10% if the spending of India's 35 states and territories is included. Under the fiscal responsibility law Mr Chidambaram has to trim the deficit by 0.3 percentage points each year a target he says he has now met for the current year.  But the heavy spending on poverty reduction means the 2005-6 target for the deficit will be 4.3% Mr Chidambaram said - falling short of the new law's requirement. ""I was left with no option but to press the pause button vis a vis the act"" he said. The following year though would have to be back on track he warned.  ""I may add that we are perilously close to the limits of fiscal prudence and there is no more room for spending beyond our means"" he said. The coming year's reduction has meant bringing more of the businesses in India's burgeoning services sector into the tax system and restructuring the personal tax system although there are numerous corporate tax and duty reductions built into the budget.  Presenting his budget in the lower house of parliament Mr Chidambaram said the Indian economy was performing strongly and that inflation has been reined in. He said India's economy grew 6.9% in 2004. In his budget Mr Chidambaram has:  - Increased spending on primary education to 71.56bn rupees ($1.6bn)   - Increased spending on health to 102.8bn rupees ($2.35bn)   - Announced that 80bn rupees ($1.8bn) will be spent on building rural infrastructure   - Pledged 102.16bn rupees ($2.3bn) for tsunami victims   - Increased flow of funds to agriculture by 30%   - Announced a package for the sugar industry  In addition up to 100bn rupees ($2.3bn) to be spent on infrastructure will be sourced by borrowing against the country's foreign exchange reserves keeping budgeted spending under control. ""Given the resilience of the Indian economy... it is possible to launch a direct assault on poverty"" Mr Chidambaram said. ""The whole purpose of democratic government is to eliminate poverty."" The new Indian government led by the Congress Party was voted into power last May after it pledged to introduce economic reforms with a ""human face"".  The finance minister says he is committed to continue reforming India's tax system while expanding the tax base. As part of his reforms he has announced:  - Duty cuts on capital goods and raw materials   - Expanded service tax net   - Raised the income-tax threshold to 100000 rupees ($2300)   - Reduced income tax for those earning less than 250000 rupees ($5700) to 20%   - Reduced corporate tax rates to 30%  An annual economic survey released on Friday said India needed to ease limit restriction on foreign investment reform labour laws and cut duties apart from widening the tax base for long-term economic growth. But Mr Chidambaram is under pressure from the Communist parties to focus on increasing social spending. The Communists are also hostile to measures seeking to increase foreign investment and allow companies to hire and fire employees at will. In recent months they have expressed their displeasure at the government's economic reform plans including increasing foreign direct investment in telecommunication and aviation. In his last budget Mr Chidambaram had pledged billions of dollars for improving education and health services for the poor as well as special assistance for farmers. ";;;
1, General Motors of the US is to pay Fiat 1.55bn euros ($2bn";" Â£1.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the Italian car maker outright.  Fiat had sold GM a stake in 2000 as part of a partnership agreement. But Fiat's heavy losses have convinced GM - whose own European operations are in the red - to back away. The pay-off means the two firms will unwind joint ventures but Fiat will keep supplying diesel engines and the money will allow it to reduce its debt. Fiat's shares on the Milan stock exchange rose 4.5% by 0900 GMT to 6.2 euros having shot up more than 7% in early trading. ""We now have absolute freedom to design our own future"" said Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne.  Analysts said Fiat seemed to have done well out of the deal although some predictions had expected a 2bn euro pay-off. Fiat is to get 1bn euros immediately with another 550m to follow within 90 days. The firm is Italy's largest private employer and a failure to reach an agreement could have had severe consequences for thousands of workers and for the Italian economy. For its part GM was keen to ward off any criticism that the deal had been a mistake.  ""We needed scale in Europe to get costs down and we were able to do that in working with Fiat"" said GM chief executive Rick Wagoner.  The Fiat-GM alliance came about in 2000 as an alternative to selling Fiat outright. German-US car firm DaimlerChrysler had been willing to buy the firm but Fiat patriarch Gianni Agnelli did not want to give up control. Instead GM swapped a 6% stake in itself for 20% of Fiat - and gave Fiat a ""put option"" to sell GM the rest of the car maker between January 2004 and July 2009. But despite the alliance Fiat failed to put itself back on track continuing to lose money and market share. As a result the sell-off looked better and better for the Italians - and much worse for GM which is struggling with its own loss-making European marques Opel and Saab. The relationship soured further after Fiat sold half its finance arm and recapitalised in 2003 halving GM's stake to 10%. ";;
1, An ex-chief financial officer at Boeing has received a four-month jail sentence and a fine of $250000 (Â£131961) for illegally hiring a top Air Force aide.  Michael Sears admitted his guilt in breaking conflict of interest laws by recruiting Darleen Druyun while she still handled military contracts. Ms Druyun is currently serving a nine month sentence for favouring Boeing when awarding lucrative contracts. Boeing lost a $23bn government contract after a Pentagon inquiry into the case. The contract to provide refuelling tankers for the US Air Force was cancelled last year.  The Pentagon revealed earlier this week that it would examine eight other contracts worth $3bn which it believes may have been tainted by Ms Druyun's role in the procurement process. Boeing sacked Mr Sears and Ms Druyun in November 2003 after allegations that they had violated company recruitment policy. Ms Druyun had talks with Mr Sears in October 2002 about working for Boeing while she was still a top procurement official within the Pentagon. She subsequently joined the company in January 2003. Ms Druyun admitted that she had steered multi-billion dollar contracts to Boeing and other favoured companies.  In documents filed in a Virginia court ahead of Mr Sears' sentencing prosecutors blamed Boeing's senior management for failing to ask key questions about the ""legal and ethical issues"" surrounding Ms Druyun's appointment. Mr Sears told prosecutors that no other Boeing officials were aware that Ms Druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing a job with Boeing. However analysts believe Boeing may yet face civil charges arising from the scandal. The Pentagon has investigated 400 contracts dating back to 1993 since the allegations against Ms Druyun came to light.  Boeing's corporate ethics have come under scrutiny on several occasions in recent years. Boeing was sued by Lockheed Martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during a 1998 contract competition. Boeing apologised publicly for the affair - although it claimed it did not gain any unfair advantage - and pledged to improve its procedures. The Pentagon subsequently revoked $1bn worth of contracts assigned to Boeing and prohibited the Seattle-based company from future rocket work. ";;;
1, Verizon has won a takeover battle for US phone firm MCI with a bid worth $6.8bn (Â£3.6bn) reports say.  The two firms are expected to seal the deal on Monday morning according to news agency reports despite what was thought to be a higher bid from Qwest. The US telecoms market is consolidating fast with former long-distance giant AT&T being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this year for $16bn. MCI exited bankruptcy in April having gone bust under previous name WorldCom. The bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits.  Shareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed while 20000 workers lost their jobs. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently on trial accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest has itself come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour paying the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep Wall Street happy.  MCI is the US's second-biggest long distance firm after AT&T. Consolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. A merger between MCI and Verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October. Last week SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. Buying MCI would give either Qwest or Verizon access to MCI's global network and business-based subscribers. The rationale is similar to the one underpinning SBC's AT&T deal. Verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm - factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and shares. ";;;
1, Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January according to government data.  New figures show the Labor Department producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. But core producer prices which exclude food and energy costs surged by 0.8% the biggest rise since December 1998 increasing inflationary concerns. In contrast the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. The university's index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public. The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade as the Dow Jones Standard and Poor's 500 and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.  The economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. The Fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since June 2004 in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.  Mr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures. ""The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace"" said Joe Quinlan chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management. ""But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending";" this could be an indication of that.""  Consumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy which is why the Michigan data is closely observed. However on Friday it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years. ""The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates"" said Paul Cherney chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's. But Ian Shepherdson chief US economist at High Frequency Economics said the PPI report was ""much less alarming"" than at first glance. One-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices which ""are no indication of broad PPI pressure"" were responsible for the increase he said. Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January but Shepherdson said ""it is a good bet these increases won't stick"". ";;
1, Russian oil firm Yukos has sued four companies for their role in last year's forced state auction of its key oil production unit Yuganskneftegas.  Yukos is claiming more than $20bn (Â£11bn) in damages after Yugansk was sold in December to settle back taxes. The four companies named in the law suit are gas giant Gazprom its unit Gazpromneft investment company Baikal and state oil firm Rosneft. Yukos submitted the suit in Houston where it filed for bankruptcy. As well as suing for damages Yukos has asked the US court to send its tax dispute with the Russian government to an international arbitrator. It also has submitted a reorganisation plan as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.  The clash between Yukos and the Kremlin came to a head last year when Yukos was hit with a bill of more than $27bn in back taxes and unpaid fines. To settle the bill Russia forced Yukos to sell off Yuganskneftegas.  Yukos called the sale illegal and has turned to courts in the US in an effort to regain control of the oil production business. It also has vowed to use all legal means at its disposal to go after any firm that tries to buy or take control of its assets. Earlier this month it sued the Russian government for $28.3bn. Analysts have questioned whether a US court has any jurisdiction over Russian companies while Moscow officials have dismissed Yukos' legal wrangling as meaningless. In Houston bankruptcy Judge Letitia Clark will start a two-day hearing on 16 February to hear arguments on whether a US court is the proper forum for the case.  The threat of legal action from Yukos and its bankruptcy filing in Houston did have an effect on last year's auction however. Concerned that it would be caught up in a court battle Gazprom and Gazpromneft withdrew from the auction and Yuganskneftegas was sold to little-known investment firm Baikal Finance Group. A few days later Baikal gave control of the company to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn. Rosneft meanwhile has agreed to merge with Gazprom bringing a large chunk of Russia's very profitable oil business back under state control. Yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky once Russia's richest man is in prison having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail. ";;;
1, US economic growth accelerated in the third quarter helped by strong consumer spending official figures have shown.  The economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.7% in the July to September period the Commerce Department said. The figure marked an increase on the 3.3% growth recorded in the second quarter but fell short of the 4.2% rate pencilled in by forecasters. The increase reflected the biggest jump in consumer spending in a year. ""It was a little softer than the consensus but not a real surprise"" said Gary Thayer an economist at AG Edwards & Sons. Friday's growth estimate is one of the last significant pieces of economic data before the 2 November presidential election.  Democrat challenger John Kerry has criticised President George W Bush's handling of the economy pointing to a net loss of over 800000 jobs since Mr Bush took office. Analysts said the economy was still not growing fast enough to stimulate large-scale job creation. ""It's a pretty good growth rate but it may not be good enough to create enough jobs"" said Robert Brusca chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics in New York. However President Bush is expected to point to Commerce Department figures showing that consumer spending grew at 4.6% in the third quarter up from just 1.6% in the second as evidence that his policies are generating solid growth. Consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the US.  The weaker than expected growth figure makes it less likely that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month economists said. ""The economy regained some traction in the third quarter but the growth is not robust"" AG Edwards' Thayer. ""I think that means the Fed can take its time raising rates. We'll probably see one more rate hike before the end of the year."" In an effort to pre-empt rising inflation the Federal Reserve has pushed through three quarter-point rate rises since June this year taking borrowing costs to 1.75%. On the financial markets the dollar fell slightly against the euro and the yen while the Dow Jones index of leading US shares was little changed. ";;;
1, The Â£10bn Crossrail transport plan backed by business groups is to get the go-ahead this month according to The Mail on Sunday.  It says the UK Treasury has allocated Â£7.5bn ($13.99bn) for the project and that talks with business groups on raising the rest will begin shortly. The much delayed Crossrail Link Bill would provide for a fast cross-London rail link. The paper says it will go before the House of Commons on 23 February.  A second reading could follow on 16 or 17 March. ""We've always said we are going to introduce a hybrid Bill for Crossrail in the Spring and this remains the case"" the Department for Transport said on Sunday. Jeremy de Souza a spokesman for Crossrail said on Sunday he could not confirm whether the Treasury was planning to invest Â£7.5bn or when the bill would go before Parliament.  However he said some impetus may have been provided by the proximity of an election.  The new line would go out as far as Maidenhead Berkshire to the west of London and link Heathrow to Canary Wharf via the City. Heathrow to the City would take 40 minutes dramatically cutting journey times for business travellers and reducing overcrowding on the tube. The line has the support of the Mayor of London Ken Livingstone business groups and the government but there have been three years of arguments over how it should be funded. The Mail on Sunday's Financial Mail said the Â£7.5bn of Treasury money was earmarked for spending in Â£2.5bn instalments in 2010 2011 and 2012. ";;;
1, Shares in Solidere the Lebanese company founded by assassinated former prime minister Rafik Hariri fell 15% in renewed trading in Beirut.  The real estate firm which dominates Lebanon's stock exchange ended the day down at $8.08. Traders said there was some panic selling during Friday's session the first since a three-day market closure to mourn the death of Mr Hariri. Beirut's benchmark BLOM stock index closed down 7.9% at 642.80.  Solidere in which Mr Hariri was a major shareholder was the major drag on the index. The company owns much of the property in central Beirut which it restored and redeveloped following the end of Lebanon's bitter 15-year civil war. ""Solidere should be above $10 but because of this disaster it is falling"" said one trader. ""If Solidere drops much lower I would consider it a buying opportunity. This is a very big company held by many Lebanese."" Critics had accused Mr Hariri of using Lebanon's post-war reconstruction drive for his personal financial gain. But his assassination on Monday sent shudders through Lebanon's business community which saw the billionaire tycoon as the country's best hope for economic revival. Solidere posted profits of $12.5m in the first half of 2004 and its shares had been gaining in recent months. ";;;
1, Rising fuel and materials costs are hitting confidence among the UK's small manufacturers despite a rise in output business lobby group the CBI says.  A CBI quarterly survey found output had risen by the fastest rate in seven years but many firms were seeing the benefits offset by increasing expenses. The CBI also found spending on innovation training and retraining is forecast to go up over the next year. However firms continue to scale back investment in buildings and machinery.  The CBI said companies are looking to the government to lessen the regulatory load and are hoping interest rates will be kept on hold. ""Smaller manufacturers are facing an uphill struggle"" said Hugh Morgan Williams chair of the CBI's SME Council. ""The manufacturing sector needs a period of long-term stability in the economy."" The CBI found some firms managed to increase prices for the first time in nine years - but many said increases failed to keep up the rise in costs. Of the companies surveyed 30% saw orders rise and 27% saw them fall. The positive balance of plus 3 compared with minus 10 in the previous survey. When firms were questioned on output volume the survey returned a balance of plus 8 - the highest rate of increase for seven years - and rose to plus 11 when looking ahead to the next three months.

1, Investors have snapped up shares in Jet Airways India's biggest airline following the launch of its much anticipated initial public offer (IPO).  The IPO for 17.3 million shares was fully sold within 10 minutes of opening on Friday. Analysts expect Jet to raise at least 16.4bn rupees ($375m"; Â£198m) from the offering. Interest in Jet's IPO has been fuelled by hopes for robust growth in India's air travel market.  The share offer representing about 20% of Jet's equity was oversubscribed news agency Reuters reported. Jet which was founded by London-based travel agent Naresh Goyal plans to use the cash to buy new planes and cut its debt. The company has grown rapidly since it launched operations in 1993 overtaking state-owned flag carrier Indian Airlines. However it faces stiff competition from rivals and low-cost carriers. Jet's IPO is the first in a series of expected share offers from Indian companies this year as they move to raise funds to help them do business in a rapidly-growing economy. ;;
1, UK house prices fell 0.7% in December according to figures from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.  Nationally house prices rose at an annual rate of 10.7% in December less than the 13.7% rise the previous month. The average UK house price fell from Â£180126 in November to Â£178906 reflecting recent Land Registry figures confirming a slowdown in late 2004. All major UK regions apart from Northern Ireland experienced a fall in annual growth during December.  December is traditionally a quiet month for the housing market because of Christmas celebrations. However recent figures from the Land Registry - showing a big drop in sales between the last quarter of 2004 and the previous year - suggested the slowdown could be more than a seasonal blip. The volume of sales between October and December dropped by nearly a quarter from the same period in 2003 the Land Registry said. Although both the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Land Registry figures point to a slowdown in the market the most recent surveys from Nationwide and Halifax have indicated the market may be undergoing a revival. After registering falls at the back-end of 2004 Halifax said house prices rose by 0.8% in January and Nationwide reported a rise of 0.4% in the first month of the year. ";;;
1, Deutsche Boerse the German stock exchange that is trying to buy its London rival has said it will boost its 2004 dividend payment by 27%.  Analysts said that the move is aimed at winning over investors opposed to its bid for the London Stock Exchange. Critics of the takeover have complained that the money could be better used by returning cash to shareholders. Deutsche Boerse also said profit in the three months to 31 December was 120.7m euros ($158.8m"; Â£83.3m). Sales climbed to 364.4m euros lifting revenue for the year to a record 1.45bn euros.  Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse has offered Â£1.3bn ($2.48bn; 1.88bn euros) for the London Stock Exchange. Rival pan-European bourse Euronext is working also on a bid. Late on Monday Deutsche Boerse said it would lift its 2004 dividend payment to 70 euro cents (Â£0.48;" $0.98) from 55 euro cents a year earlier. ""There is a whiff of a sweetener in there"" Anais Faraj an analyst at Nomura told the BBC's World Business Report. ""Most of the disgruntled shareholders of Deutsche Boerse are complaining that the money that is being used for the bid could be better placed in their hands paid out in dividends"" Mr Faraj continued. Deutsche Boerse is ""trying to buy them off in a sense"" he said. "
1, The European Union's newest members will bolster Europe's economic growth in 2005 according to a new report.  The eight central European states which joined the EU last year will see 4.6% growth the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) said. In contrast the 12 Euro zone countries will put in a ""lacklustre"" performance generating growth of only 1.8%. The global economy will slow in 2005 the UNECE forecasts due to widespread weakness in consumer demand.  It warned that growth could also be threatened by attempts to reduce the United States' huge current account deficit which in turn might lead to significant volatility in exchange rates.  UNECE is forecasting average economic growth of 2.2% across the European Union in 2005. However total output across the Euro zone is forecast to fall in 2004 from 1.9% to 1.8%. This is due largely to the faltering German economy which shrank 0.2% in the last quarter of 2004. On Monday Germany's BdB private banks association said the German economy would struggle to meet its 1.4% growth target in 2005.  Separately the Bundesbank warned that Germany's efforts to reduce its budget deficit below 3% of GDP presented ""huge risks"" given that headline economic growth was set to fall below 1% this year. Publishing its 2005 economic survey the UNECE said central European countries such as the Czech Republic and Slovenia would provide the backbone of the continent's growth. Smaller nations such as Cyprus Ireland and Malta would also be among the continent's best performing economies this year it said. The UK economy on the other hand is expected to slow in 2005 with growth falling from 3.2% last year to 2.5%.  Consumer demand will remain fragile in many of Europe's largest countries and economies will be mostly driven by growth in exports. ""In view of the fragility of factors of domestic growth and the dampening effects of the stronger euro on domestic economic activity and inflation monetary policy in the euro area is likely to continue to 'wait and see' the organisation said in its report. Global economic growth is expected to fall from 5% in 2004 to 4.25% despite the continued strength of the Chinese and US economies. The UNECE warned that attempts to bring about a controlled reduction in the US current account deficit could cause difficulties. ""The orderly reversal of the deficit is a major challenge for policy makers in both the United States and other economies"" it noted. ";;;
1, Heineken and Carlsberg two of the world's largest brewers have reported falling profits after beer sales in western Europe fell flat.  Dutch firm Heineken saw its annual profits drop 33% and warned that earnings in 2005 may also slide. Danish brewer Carlsberg suffered a 3% fall in profits due to waning demand and increased marketing costs. Both are looking to Russia and China to provide future growth as western European markets are largely mature.  Heineken's net income fell to 537m euros ($701m";" Â£371m) during 2004 from 798m euro a year ago. It blamed weak demand in western Europe and currency losses. It had warned in September that the weakening US dollar which has cut the value of foreign sales would knock 125m euros off its operating profits. Despite the dip in profits Heineken's sales have been improving and total revenue for the year was 10bn euros up 8.1% from 9.26bn euros in 2003. Heineken said it now plans to invest 100m euros in ""aggressive"" and ""high-impact"" marketing in Europe and the US in 2005. Heineken which also owns the Amstel and Murphy's stout brands said it would also seek to cut costs. This may involve closing down breweries.  Heineken increased its dividend payment by 25% to 40 euro cents but warned that the continued impact of a weaker dollar and an increased marketing spend may lead to a drop in 2005 net profit.  Carlsberg the world's fifth-largest brewer saw annual pre-tax profits fall to 3.4bn Danish kroner (456m euros). Its beer sales have been affected by the sluggish European economy and by the banning of smoking in pubs in several European countries. Nevertheless total sales increased 4% to 36bn kroner thanks to strong sales of Carlsberg lager in Russia and Poland. Carlsberg is more optimistic than Heineken about 2005 projecting a 15% rise in net profits for the year. However it also plans to cut 200 jobs in Sweden where sales have been hit by demand for cheap imported brands. ""We remain cautious about the medium-to-long term outlook for revenue growth across western Europe for a host of economic social and structural reasons"" investment bank Merrill Lynch said of Carlsberg.

1, Yangtze Electric Power the operator of China's Three Gorges Dam has said its profits more than doubled in 2004.  The firm has benefited from increased demand for electricity at a time when power shortages have hit cities and provinces across the country. As a hydroelectric-power generator it has not been hurt by higher coal costs. Net income jumped to 3bn yuan in 2004 ($365m";" Â£190m) compared with 1.4bn yuan in 2003. Sales surged to 6.2bn yuan from 3bn yuan a year earlier. The figures topped analysts expectations even though the rate of growth has slowed from 2003. Analysts forecast that it is likely to decline further this year to a rate of expansion of closer to 20%.  Yangtze Electric has been expanding its output to meet demand driven by China's booming economy. The government has delayed the building of a number of power plants in an effort to rein in growth amid concerns that the economy may overheat. That has led to an energy crunch with demand outstripping supply. Earlier this month work was halted on an underground power station and a supply unit on the Three Gorges Dam as well as a power station on its sister Xiluodu dam because of environmental worries. A total of 30 large-scale projects have been halted across the country for similar reasons. The Three Gorges Dam project has led to more than half a million people being relocated and drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. Its sister project the Xiluodu Dam is being built on the Jinshajiang - or ""river of golden sand"" as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. ";;
1, French consumers increased their spending by 1.5% in January a figure which bodes well for the country's economic growth figures revealed.  The National Statistic Institute (INSEE) added that consumer spending in January rose 3.8% on a year-on-year basis. Rising sales of household equipment were behind the increase. The INSEE also said that French consumer prices fell 0.6% in January but were up 1.6% on an annual basis.  Despite the general increase in spending in January French households bought fewer cars in January. According to the INSEE car sales fell 2.8% in January following a fall of 0.6% in December. But on a year-on-year basis the sector still saw a sales increase of 6.5%. Consumer spending fuelled France's economic growth in the last quarter of 2004 and analysts expect that it will continue to support the economy. ""It's a growth that will remain fragile and vulnerable to risks like a strong rise in long-term interest rates tension in the oil price"" Emmanuel Ferry from Exane BNP Paribas told Reuters news agency.  Meanwhile in Italy consumer confidence rose to its highest level since October 2004. Economic research group ISAE has said that Italian consumer confidence rose to 104.4 from 103.3 despite a slight deterioration in short-term sentiment. ";;;
1, One of the world's largest manufacturers of HIV/Aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills - supplied to poorer African countries - back into Europe for resale at far higher price.  The company GlaxoSmithKline is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement. It is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way. This is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies. They want to maintain their profits but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap anti-Aids drugs to the world's poorest nations.  The result is that drugs supplied to Africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in Europe"; bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of HIV-positive Africans through their government's health care systems.  But the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and re-selling them at a higher price. GlaxoSmithKline believes that by coating the pills destined for Africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging then this trade can be substantially reduced. The company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in Africa who have re-sold humanitarian drugs for profit as well as those suppliers in Europe that have also been involved in the trade. Glaxo says distribution of the new-look drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in Europe. ;;
1, The UK property market remains robust despite the recent slowdown according to mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley and housebuilder George Wimpey.  B&B said the buy-to-let market - in which the bank is a major player - would continue to grow much faster than the wider mortgage market. The comments came as it reported a 6% rise in profits to Â£280.2m ($532m). Wimpey reported a 19% rise in profits to Â£450.7m and said recent new home reservations were better than expected.  Recent housing market surveys have indicated that the UK property market has cooled in recent months after several years of rapid growth. Last week figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) indicated that the popularity of buy-to-let mortgages - a key phenomenon of the housing boom - could be waning.  But B&B - which has a 22% share of the UK buy-to-let mortgage market - said that while rates of growth were moderating the sector ""continues to grow at a rate considerably above that of the whole mortgage market"". Overall B&B said that ""housing market fundamentals remain strong"". ""Interest rates and unemployment are both likely to remain at historically low levels real household incomes should continue to grow and housing demand is likely to outstrip supply into the medium-term."" Despite the upbeat tone shares in B&B were down more than 4% at 325.5p in morning trade as analysts worried over future earnings growth.  Wimpey's profit figures came in at the top of expectations with the numbers helped by buoyant sales in the US offsetting a slight slowdown in the UK. Wimpey said the UK housing market had proved ""challenging"" last year. ""By late summer the market in general had slowed sharply across the country and showed no real improvement during the autumn"" it added. However the first seven weeks of this year had produced promising signs Wimpey said. ""Visitor levels and interest in this period have been encouraging and reservations have been at the stronger end of our expectations."" Shares in Wimpey were up 6% at 458.5p in morning trade. ";;;
1, Talks on Russia's proposed membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) have been ""making good progress"" say those behind the negotiations.  But the chairman of the working party Ambassador Stefan Johannesson of Iceland warned that there was ""still a lot of work has to be done"". His comments came as President George W Bush said the US backed Russian entry. But he said for Russia to make progress the government must ""renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law"". His comments come three days before he is due to meet President Vladimir Putin.  Russia has been waiting for a decade to join the WTO and hopes to finally become a member by early 2006. A decision could be reached in December when the WTO's 148 current members gather for a summit in Hong Kong. That would allow an earliest date for membership of January 2006 if the Hong Kong summit gave its approval. While pinpointing several areas in which there are difficulties in the bilateral and multilateral work with Russia the US said the meeting was ""much more efficient than we've seen for some time"". And Australia said it was ""one of the best (meetings) we can recall in terms of substance"". Mr Johannesson also said progress ""on the bilateral market access side is accelerating"". Sticking points to membership have included limits on foreign ownership in the telecommunications and life insurance businesses as well as issues surrounding counterfeiting piracy and data protection. Some WTO members also dislike Russia's energy price subsidies which competitors say give Russian businesses an unfair advantage. ";;;
1, Irishmen JP McManus and John Magnier who own a 29% stake in Manchester United will reportedly reject any formal Â£800m offer for the club.  The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph say they will oppose any formal Â£800m takeover bid from US tycoon Malcom Glazer. Mr Glazer got permission to look at the club's accounts last week. Irish billionaires Mr McManus and Mr Magnier are said to believe that an Â£800m bid undervalues club prospects.  Mr Magnier and Mr McManus who hold their stake through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle have the power to block a bid. Mr Glazer's financial backers including JP Morgan the US investment bank have said they won't back a bid unless it receives backing from the owners of at least 75% of the club's shares. However there has been much speculation that the Irish duo simply do not think the price offered - 300p a share - is high enough. Mr Glazer has been stalking the premier league football club since 2003.  Mr Magnier and Mr McManus issued a statement late on Friday saying that they remained ""long-term investors"" in Man Utd. The Sunday Telegraph says the board of Manchester United also considered a management buyout at just over 300p but did not go ahead with it. ";;;
1, The US dollar has dropped against major currencies on concerns that central banks may cut the amount of dollars they hold in their foreign reserves.  Comments by South Korea's central bank at the end of last week have sparked the recent round of dollar declines. South Korea which has about $200bn in foreign reserves said it plans instead to boost holdings of currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollar. Analysts reckon that other nations may follow suit and now ditch the dollar. At 1300 GMT the euro was up 0.9% on the day at 1.3187 euros per US dollar. The British pound had added 0.5% to break through the $1.90 level while the dollar had fallen by 1.3% against the Japanese yen to trade at 104.16 yen.  At the start of the year the US currency which had lost 7% against the euro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows staged something of a recovery.  Analysts however pointed to the dollar's inability recently to extend that rally despite positive economic and corporate data and highlighted the fact that many of the US's economic problems had not disappeared. The focus once again has been on the country's massive trade and budget deficits with predictions of more dollar weakness to come. ""The comments from Korea came at a time when sentiment towards the dollar was already softening"" said Ian Gunner a trader at Mellon Financial. On Tuesday traders in Asia said that both South Korea and Taiwan had withdrawn their bids to buy dollars at the start of the session. Mansoor Mohi-Uddin chief currency strategist at UBS said that there was a sentiment in the market that ""central banks from Asia and the Middle East are buying euros"". A report last month already showed that the dollar was losing its allure as a currency that offered rock-steady returns and stability. Compiled by Central Banking Publications and sponsored by the UK's Royal Bank of Scotland the survey found 39 nations out of 65 questioned were increasing their euro holdings with 29 cutting back on the US dollar.

1, India and Russia are to work together in a series of energy deals part of a pact which could see India invest up to $20bn in oil and gas projects.  On the agenda are oil and gas extraction as well as transportation deals to be led by Russian energy giant Gazprom and India's ONGC. The Indian firm is also expected to hold talks on Tuesday about buying a stake in assets once owned by Yukos. It is reported to be keen on buying a 15% stake in oil unit Yuganskneftegas. The former Yukos subsidiary was controversially sold off last year and eventually acquired by state-owned energy giant Rosneft.  Russian media reported that India and Russia signed a memorandum of understanding on energy co-operation on Tuesday during a meeting between Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha Gazprom chairman Aleksey Miller and India's petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar.  The agreement is likely to see the two companies develop refining facilities in Russia India and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil gas and petrochemicals from Russia to India and other countries across Asia. ONGC could invest in gas and oil fields in Sakhalin in the far east of Russia and may also take part in joint tender bids for projects in eastern Siberia and the Caspian Sea.  India is urgently searching for fresh energy supplies - particularly liquefied natural gas - as domestic demand is growing at more than 5% a year.  ONGC's Mr Raha said the two could work together on joint bids from next year. ""At current oil and gas prices our cash flow situation is good"" he told Reuters. ""What we are saying is - Gazprom has a huge amount of gas and we have the money. ""The investment may go up to $20bn or more for a period of five years or so.""  Russian news agencies reported that India's petroleum minister Mr Aiyar and Russian energy minister Viktor Khristenko would discuss the future of Yugansk at a meeting on Tuesday. ONGC's Mr Raha declined to be drawn on his firm's reported interest in the company. However he stressed that ONGC was not interested in a 'loan-for-oil deal' in connection to Yugansk similar to that concluded recently between Rosneft and China's National Petroleum Corporation. ""China's problem is it has immediate demand and they needed the oil for their coastal refineries. We do not. We would like long-term security through equity participation."" It is thought that any decision over Yugansk will be delayed until a US court has decided whether to grant Yukos bankruptcy protection. Yukos is suing a host of companies involved in the sale of Yugansk auctioned off to pay a huge back-tax bill. It has also threatened legal action against any business which has future commercial dealings with its former subsidiary. ";;;
1, A batch of downbeat government data has cast doubt over the French economy's future prospects.  Official figures showed on Friday that unemployment was unchanged at 9.9% last month while consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in October. At the same time finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy warned that high oil prices posed a threat to French growth. ""[Oil prices] will weigh on consumer spending in the short term and potentially on confidence"" he said. World oil prices have risen by more than 60% since the start of the year as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand.  Analysts said French companies keen to protect their profit margins at a time of rising energy costs were reluctant to take on extra staff. ""[The unemployment figures] show the main problem of the French economy: we have growth but without an improvement in employment"" said Marc Touati an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires. ""Politicians must have the will and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms otherwise in five or ten years it will be too late."" Obligatory employer contributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to hire staff in France than in many other European economies. Many economists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing non-wage payroll costs and by scrapping restrictions on working hours. The French statistics agency INSEE expects the economy to grow by about 2.4% this year buoyed by strong consumer spending and business investment. That is above the projected eurozone average of just above 2%. ";;;
1, As European leaders gather in Rome on Friday to sign the new EU constitution many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - namely how to stay in business.  Lille is a popular tourist destination for Britons who want a taste of France at the weekend. But how many tourists look at the impressively grand Victorian Chambre de Commerce which stands beside the Opera House and consider that it was built - like the town halls in many northern English towns - on the wealth created by coal steel and textiles? Like northern England and industrial Scotland those industries have been in long term decline - the last coal pit closed in 1990. Beck-Crespel is a specialist steel firm in Armentieres about 20 miles from Lille. The company has not laid off a worker since 1945. It specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry but not many of those are being built in Europe these days.  Director Hugues Charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the Far East are able to make some of his output more cheaply while his key markets are now in China and India. ""In our business the market is absolutely global you can not imagine living with our size (of business) even within an enlarged European Union (if we did that) we would need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200"" he says. It isn't just globalisation that is hurting";" the law in France means workers are paid for a 39 hour week even though they work just 35 hours. But at least there is still a steel industry. Coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling. New business has been attracted but not enough to make up the difference.  That is one reason why people here are not great fans of the EU says Frederic Sawicki a politics lecturer at the University of Lille.  ""In the region today the unemployment rate is 12% in some areas it is 15%. They don't see what Europe is doing for them so there is a kind of euro scepticism especially in the working classes"" he says. Which is strange because Lille is at the crossroads of Europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here. The euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world. Much of that trade passes through the world's largest port Rotterdam in Holland home to specialist crane maker Huisman Itrec. Its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken Russian submarine Kursk from the sea bed but Huisman Itrec is now setting up a factory in China where costs are cheaper and its main customers are closer.  Boss Henk Addink blames the low growth rate in Europe for the lack of orders closer to home. ""In the US growth is something like 6% in China they are estimating 15% and in the EU it is more or less 1%"" he says. Mr Addink blames the euro for stifling demand. He much preferred the old currencies of Europe which moved in relation to each country's economic performance. In Germany industry is exporting more these days but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment. Growth is likely to peak this year at just under 2%. In Britain that would be a bad year";" in Germany it is one of the best in recent years. With Germany making up a third of the eurozone's economy this is a major problem. If Germany doesn't once again become the powerhouse of Europe growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be. However at one factory near the Dutch border things are changing.  The Siemens plant at Boscholt makes cordless phones and employs 2000 staff. Staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra pay after Siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to Hungary. Factory manager Herbert Stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity ""by nearly 30%"". But Germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such Hungary or China. The Government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers says Helmut Schneider director of the Institute for the Study of Labour at Bonn University. ""Labour is too costly in Germany especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem. If we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half"" he says. The EU set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010. Four years into that process and the target seems further away than ever. ";
1, Marks & Spencer has cut prices in London and the regions by an average of 24% according to research from a City investment bank.  Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said: ""In spite of the snow in the UK it still feels very early to be cutting prices of spring merchandise."" Stuart Rose head of M&S said last year its prices were too high. ""We are bringing in ranges at new price points to compete against mid-market retailers like Next"" said M&S.  Next is one of M&S's biggest competitors and the move may force it to lower prices. DrKW said the cuts are either to clear stock or could indicate a longer term ""step change in pricing in certain areas"" at M&S. ""Either way this cannot be good news for M&S' margin"" it added. ""We have brought in quite a lot of new clothing at new price points as part of Stuart Rose's strategy of quality style -and price"" said the M&S spokesman. Many analysts believe February is proving to be a difficult month for retailers and British Retail Consortium figures due in a few weeks are expected to reflect the tough trading environment. Separately investment bank Goldman Sachs produced reseach showing that a basket of 35 M&S goods is now 11% above the high-street average compared with 43% higher last year.  It has been a strange week for M&S which on Tuesday received a statement from Philip Green the billionaire Bhs owner confirming he was not rebidding for the company. This was followed the same day by Mark Paulsmeier a South African financier issuing a press release saying his Paulsmeier Group was interested in M&S. A sudden spike in M&S's share price followed. However an M&S spokesman said on Sunday it had no evidence that Mr Paulsmeier had lined up sufficient finance for a bid. He also said the Takeover Panel and the UK's financial watchdog the Financial Services Authority had been in touch with M&S at the beginning of the week to find out what it knew about the Paulsmeier developments.

1, The Bank of America has revealed it has lost computer tapes containing account details of more than one million customers who are US federal employees.  Several members of the US Senate are among those affected who could now be vulnerable to identity theft. Senate sources say the missing tapes may have been stolen from a plane by baggage handlers. The bank gave no details of how the records disappeared but said they had probably not been misused. Customers' accounts were being monitoring and account holders would be notified if any ""unusual activity"" was detected bank officials said.  Bank of America said the tapes went missing in December while being shipped to a back-up data centre. ""We with federal law authorities have done a very robust thorough investigation on this and neither we nor they would make the statement lightly that we believe those tapes to be lost"" Alexandra Tower a spokeswoman for the North Carolina-based bank told Time magazine. But although there was no evidence of criminal activity the bank said the Secret Service - a federal agency whose brief includes investigations of serious financial crime - is said to be looking into the loss. New York Senator Charles Schumer said he was told by the Senate Rules Committee that the tapes were probably stolen from a commercial plane. ""Whether it is identity theft terrorism or other theft in this new complicated world baggage handlers should have background checks and more care should be taken for who is hired for these increasingly sensitive positions"" the Democrat senator said. Details of his Vermont colleague Pat Leahy's credit card account are among those missing Senator Leahy's spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler said. About 900000 military and civilian staff at the defence department are among the 1.2 million affected according to a Pentagon spokesman. ";;;
1, Indian airline Jet Airways' initial public offering was oversubscribed 16.2 times bankers said on Friday.  Over 85% of the bids were at the higher end of the price range of 1050-1125 rupees ($24-$26). Jet Airways a low-fare airline was founded by London-based ex-travel agent Naresh Goya and controls 45% of the Indian domestic airline market. It sold 20% of its equity or 17.2 million shares in a bid to raise up to $443m (Â£230.8m). The price at which its shares will begin trading will be agreed over the weekend bankers said. ""The demand for the IPO was impressive. We believe that over the next two years the domestic aviation sector promises strong growth even though fuel prices could be high"" said Hiten Mehta manager of merchant banking firm Fortune Financial Services. India began to open up its domestic airline market - previously dominated by state-run carrier Indian Airlines - in the 1990s. Jet began flying in 1993 and now has competitors including Air Deccan and Air Sahara. Budget carriers Kingfisher Airlines and SpiceJet are planning to launch operations in May this year. Jet has 42 aircraft and runs 271 scheduled flights daily within India. It recently won government permission to fly to London Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. ";;;
1, A US bank has said it will donate more than $8m to victims of former Chilean military ruler Augusto Pinochet's regime under a Madrid court settlement.  Riggs Bank will put money in a special fund to be managed by a Madrid-based charity the Salvador Allende Foundation which helps abused victims. The bank had been accused of illegally concealing Gen Pinochet's assets. More than 3000 people were killed for political reasons under Gen Pinochet's regime an official report says. Last month in a US court Riggs Bank pleaded guilty to failing to report suspicious activity relating to accounts held by Gen Pinochet and the government of Equatorial Guinea. On that occasion it was ordered to pay a fine of $16m. Gen Pinochet himself has never been put on trial for human rights violations under his 1973-90 rule despite several high-profile cases against him. He is now facing charges relating to the murder of one Chilean and the disappearance of nine others. He is also being investigated for tax evasion tax fraud and embezzlement of state funds.  The general's opponents rejoiced at the settlement which was agreed in a court in the Spanish capital Madrid. A lawyer for the victims Eduardo Contreras told Reuters news agency: ""This demonstrates that the horrors of the Pinochet dictatorship are not a mystery to anyone and that the whole world knows his victims deserve reparations."" Riggs spokesman Mark Hendrix said the settlement details of which will be announced next week was an opportunity to move on. ""This enables the institution to put the matter behind us"" he told Reuters. The settlement follows a legal complaint filed against the bank by Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon alleging that it had illegally concealed assets. The bank agreed to create a fund for the victims but the charges were dropped. ";;;
1, US phone company Qwest has said it will table a new offer for MCI after losing out to larger rival Verizon setting the scene for a possible bidding war.  MCI accepted a $6.75bn (Â£3.6bn) buyout from telecoms giant Verizon on Monday rejecting a higher offer from Qwest. Qwest chairman Richard Notebaert sent a letter to MCI's board on Thursday saying that it plans to submit a new offer after examining Verizon's bid. Formerly known as Worldcom MCI is a long-distance and corporate phone firm. Snapping up MCI would give the buyer access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. Shares of MCI were up more than 4% in electronic trading after the close of New York markets.  Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn. ""We would like to advise you that once we have completed our review of the Verizon merger agreement we do intend to submit a modified offer to acquire MCI"" the letter from Qwest said. Verizon's offer is made up of cash shares and dividends and a number of investors have said that it undervalues MCI. Verizon plans to swap 0.41 of its shares and $1.50 in cash for each MCI share as well as offering special dividends of $4.50 a share. Both company boards have backed the deal but regulators will still need to give their approval. As well as trying to lure investors with the promise of better returns Qwest also reckons that its offer will face less regulatory scrutiny than Verizon's.  The takeover would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. Earlier this month SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. There may be concerns other than cash however especially as MCI only emerged from bankruptcy protection last April. Verizon is far bigger than Qwest has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. Also MCI while trading under the name Worldcom became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in US history after admitting that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently standing trial accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest meanwhile had to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it massaged earnings to keep Wall Street happy. ";;;
1, The chief executive of the Fiat conglomerate has taken day-to-day control of its struggling car business in an effort to turn it around.  Sergio Marchionne has replaced Herbert Demel as chief executive of Fiat Auto with Mr Demel leaving the company. Mr Marchionne becomes the fourth head of the business - which is expected to make a 800m euro ($1bn) loss in 2004 - in as many years. Fiat underperformed the market in Europe last year seeing flat sales.  The car business has made an operating loss in five of the last six years and was forced to push back its break-even target from 2005 to 2006. The management changes are part of a wider shake-up of the business following Fiat's resolution of its dispute with General Motors. As part of a major restructuring Fiat is to integrate the Maserati car company - currently owned by Ferrari - within its own operations. Ferrari in which Fiat owns a majority stake could be separately floated on the stock market in either 2006 or 2007.  Mr Marchionne who only joined the company last year said Fiat Auto was now the ""principal focus"" of his attention. ""I have made the decision to take on the post of chief executive of the auto unit to speed up the company's recovery"" he said. ""A profound cultural transformation is underway following a management reorganisation that has delivered a more agile and efficient structure"" he added.  Although Mr Marchionne does not have a background in the car industry he has been playing an increasing role in the group's activities. Last year he said that a series of new models launched as part of the group's recovery plan had not boosted revenues as much as hoped. The car business best known for its Alfa Romeo marque is expected to make a loss of about 800m euros in 2004. Sales are expected to fall in 2005 Fiat said this week as it exits unprofitable areas such as the rental car market. Mr Demel a car industry veteran took the helm in November 2003 after being recruited by former Fiat chief executive Giuseppe Morchio. Mr Morchio made a bid last year to become chairman after the death of president Umberto Agnelli. However this was rejected by the founding Agnelli family and Mr Morchio subsequently resigned. Earlier this week Fiat reached an agreement with GM to dissolve an alliance which could have obliged GM to buy the Italian firm outright. GM will pay Fiat $2bn as part of the settlement. ";;;
1, France's economic growth accelerated in the last three months of 2004 driven by consumer spending a report shows.  Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.8% in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three month period the statistical office INSEE said. That expansion pushed annual growth to 2.3% the fastest rate in two years. Consumer spending was up by 1.2% in the fourth quarter and there also was a rebound in business investment that gave the recovery an extra shove.  Analysts warned that France still was facing challenges and was unlikely to keep expanding at its current pace.  ""France still has a strong economic growth"" said Marc Toutai an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires. ""But if we check the figures in detail there's a problem."" ""Consumer spending is still high. But French households have spent their savings to consume. ""France can't sustain a high growth rate without an improvement in the job market. There's too much of a gap between growth and employment."" Unemployment levels are currently stuck at about 10% and is proving difficult to bring down despite government efforts. Another worry is that demand in Germany and Italy two of France's main trading partners is sluggish.  Despite the concerns analysts pointed out that France was outperforming the majority of its European counterparts and that its economy was looking more robust than in previous years. As well as strong domestic demand exports climbed by 1.3% in the fourth quarter - the biggest increase in foreign sales for a year. ""It's an economic growth that seems well balanced"" said Nicolas Claquin an analyst at CCF. ""In the beginning of 2004 growth was mainly driven by consumer spending. Here it gets contributions from investment and exports though household consumption is still strong. ""But we expect overall economic growth to fall to 2.0 percent in 2005."" ";;;
1, US food and drug regulators will decide on Friday whether to recommend the sale of painkillers that have been linked to a high risk of heart attack and stroke.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel will give its verdict after hearing evidence for three days. The painkillers - called COX-2 inhibitors - are sold under brand names such as Celebrex and Vioxx. Vioxx was withdrawn from shops last year but Merck said it would consider selling it if it gets FDA approval. The FDA has been asked to decide if the benefits to patients justify the increased risks.  Putting Vioxx back on the shelves is likely to boost profits at Merck and make easier any legal battles with people who claim to have been injured by the drug analysts said.  Merck voluntarily stopped sales of Vioxx on 30 September a move which caused the firm's fourth-quarter earnings to slide to $1.1bn (Â£581m) from $1.4bn a year earlier. Merck's shares tumbled more than 10% on the news and the company has had to set aside millions of dollars to cover the cost of Vioxx-related litigation. Alarm bells were rung by a research note called Approve which showed that the risk of heart attack and stroke doubled in patients who had been taking the drug for at least 18 months. The Cox-2 inhibitors were developed by drug companies including Merck and Pfizer because they cause users fewer stomach problems than other painkillers.  Pfizer is still selling its Celebrex and Bextra products though investigations have suggested that they may also be harmful to the heart. Merck's announcement of a possible reintroduction of Vioxx caught analysts by surprise. Merck's head of research Peter Kim said that it withdrew Vioxx ""based on the information that was available to us at the time knowing there were alternative therapies"". He went on to say that things have since changed in the light of new reports. ""Given this new information its is not clear that the cardiovascular risk observed in Approve makes Vioxx unique in the class of similar drugs marketed in the US"" Mr Kim explained.  On Thursday David Graham from the FDA's Office of Drug Safety told the advisory panel that ""there really doesn't appear to be a need for Cox-2"" inhibitors. According to calculations presented to the US Senate by Dr Graham in November Vioxx may be linked to as many as to 56000 American deaths. Facing stem criticism for its handling of the Vioxx case the FDA said on Tuesday that it will create an independent body to oversee the safety of drugs already in the market place. European regulators meanwhile ruled on Thursday that patients who have had heart disease or a stroke should not take Cox-2 inhibitors. The European Medicines Agency also said doctors should be ""cautious"" about giving the drugs to patients who have risk factors for heart disease. ";;;
1, Russian authorities do not have to abide by any US court decisions taken with regard to troubled oil giant Yukos a Houston court has been told.  Legal expert William Butler said there was no treaty between the US and Russia to recognise the other's legal rulings. That meant Moscow would not have to adhere to US rulings in the Yukos case. Yukos says a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold since it has a US subsidiary and local bank accounts.  Yukos made its surprise Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in Houston in December in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of Yugansk its main oil producing unit by Russian authorities. Yugansk was sold to help pay off a $27.5bn (Â£14.5bn) back tax bill. It was bought for $9.4bn by a previously unknown group which was in turn bought by state-controlled oil company Rosneft. The US court's jurisdiction has been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft. Deutsche Bank maintains the case has no place in a US court because Yukos has no assets in the US apart from two bank accounts and a house in Houston owned by its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore. Deutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos. It had agreed to loan Gazpromneft the money to bid for Yugansk. US bankruptcy judge Letitia Clark who issued an injunction in December to try and prevent the Yugansk sale has said she will rule ""pretty promptly however I do not anticipate ruling on it before next Tuesday"".  Yukos has claimed it sought help in the US because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection. It has claimed that Russia imposed the huge tax bill and forced the sale of Yugansk as part of a campaign to destroy Yukos and its former owner Mihkail Khodorkovsky who is facing a 10-year prison term in Russia for fraud and tax evasion. Yukos' parent company the Gibraltar-based Menatep Group is suing Russia in Europe for $28.3bn in financial damages. The company is also seeking $20bn in a separate US lawsuit against Rosneft and Gazprom for their role in the sale of Yugansk. ";;;
1, German football club and former European champion Borussia Dortmund has warned it will go bankrupt if rescue talks with creditors fail.  The company's shares tumbled after it said it has ""entered a life-threatening profitability and financial situation"". Borussia Dortmund has posted record losses and missed rent payments on its Westfallen stadium. Chief executive Gerd Niebaum stepped down last week and creditors are now pushing for greater control. Shares in Borussia Dortmund Germany's only stock-market listed football club dropped by almost 23% to 2.05 euros during early afternoon trading.  Fund manager Florian Hamm - Borussia Dortmund's largest investor - said he would only invest more money in the company if he got a greater say in how it is run. ""I demand better transparency"" he is quoted as saying by Germany's Manger Magazin. The club has also faced calls to appoint executives from outside the club.  Borussia Dortmund posted a record loss of 68m euros ($89m";" Â£47m) in the 12 months through June. It made a loss of 27.2m euros in the first half of the current fiscal year and said that total debts will increase to 134.7m euros by the middle of 2006 unless a restructuring plan is pushed through. ""This is the bill for their mismanagement over the past years"" said HVB analyst Peter-Thilo Halser. The club appointed an auditor who has recommended a number of steps including deferring the rent due on the stadium and suspending debt repayments until at least the 2006-2007 fiscal year. Stephen Schechter a UK investment banker who has held talks with Borussia Dortmund over a possible bond sale said the club needs a capital injection of 35m euros. ""They need strong people on the board who do not have a history with the club"" he said. ";;
1, UK mortgage lending showed a ""post-Christmas lull"" in January indicating a slowing housing market lenders have said.  Both the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) and Building Society Association (BSA) said lending was down sharply. The CML said gross mortgage lending stood at Â£17.9bn compared with Â£21.8bn in January last year. The BSA said mortgage approvals - loans approved but not yet made - were Â£2bn down from Â£2.6bn in January 2004.  At the same time the British Bankers' Association (BBA) said lending was ""weaker"". Overall the BBA said mortgage lending rose by Â£4bn in January a far smaller increase than the Â£5.1bn seen in December. This was a return to the ""weaker pattern"" of lending seen in the last months of 2004 the BBA added. However it is the year-on-year lending comparisons which are the most striking. The CML said lending for house purchases and gross mortgage lending were 29% and 18% lower year-on-year respectively. ""These figures show beyond doubt the recent slowdown in the housing market"" Peter Williams CML deputy director said. ";;;
1, The UK government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its ""golden rule"" a report suggests.  The rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest and not to finance its spending projects. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) claims that taxes need to rise by about Â£10bn if state finances are to be put in order. The Treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008. According to NIESR if the government's current economic cycle runs until March 2006 then it is ""unlikely"" the golden rule will be met. Should the cycle end a year earlier then the chances improve to ""50/50"". Either way fiscal tightening is needed NIESR said.  The report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections. Earlier this month accountancy firm Ernst & Young said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic.  It claimed revenues were likely to be Â£6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts. A Treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims saying it was ""on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond"". ""Spending plans have been set out until 2008 and they are fully affordable."" Other than its warning on possible tax hikes the NIESR report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy.  It said the recent record-busting surge in oil prices would have a limited effect on worldwide expansion saying that if anything the ""world economy will continue to grow strongly"". Global gross domestic product (GDP) is tipped to be 4.1% this year dipping to 4% in 2005 before picking up again to 4.2% in 2006. The US will continue to drive expansion until 2006 albeit at a slightly slower rate as will be the case in Japan. Hinting at better times for UK exporters NIESR said the euro zone ""is expected to pick up speed"".  Growth in Britain also is set to accelerate it forecast. ""Despite weak growth in the third quarter the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006"" NIESR said adding that ""the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery"". GDP is expected at 3.2% in 2004 and 2.8% in both 2005 and 2006. The main cloud on the horizon NIESR said was the UK's much analysed and fretted over property market. ";;;
1, The former chief financial officer at US telecoms firm WorldCom has finished giving evidence at the trial of his ex-boss Bernie Ebbers.  Scott Sullivan admitted to jurors he was willing to commit fraud to meet Wall Street earnings projections. Mr Ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldCom's collapse in 2002. He pleads not guilty. Mr Sullivan has spent two days being cross-examined by lawyers for former Worldcom chief executive Mr Ebbers.  Attorney Reid Weingarten has attempted to portray Mr Sullivan as a liar and on Thursday quizzed him about his decision to commit fraud to meet analysts' profit estimates. ""At that point in time"" Mr Sullivan said referring to the first false entries in late 2000 ""I knew it was wrong and I knew it was against the law but I thought we would get through it in the short term."" Mr Sullivan 42 has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following Mr Ebbers' trial where he is appearing as a prosecution witness. Mr Ebbers 63 has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldCom's finances. The former finance officer said Mr Ebbers knew about the improper accounting entries that were made between 2000 and 2002 to conceal soaring expenses and inflate revenue.  Mr Ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. WorldCom's problems appear to have begun with the collapse of the dotcom boom which cut its business from internet companies. Prosecutors allege that the company's top executives responded by orchestrating massive fraud over a two-year period. WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004 and is now known as MCI. On Monday MCI agreed to a buyout by Verizon Communications in a deal valued at $6.75bn. ";;;
1, The controversial sell-off of a Ukrainian steel mill to a relative of the former president was illegal a court has ruled.  The mill Krivorizhstal was sold in June 2004 for $800m (Â£424m) - well below other offers. President Viktor Yushchenko elected in December is planning to revisit many of Ukraine's recent privatisations. Krivorizhstal is one of dozens of firms which he says were sold cheaply to friends of the previous administration.  On Wednesday Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said as many as 3000 firms could be included on the list of firms whose sale was being reviewed.  Mr Yushchenko had previously said the list would be limited to 30-40 enterprises. More than 90000 businesses in all from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts have been sold off since 1992 as the command economy built up when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union was dismantled. Analysts have suggested that the government needs to avoid the impression of an open-ended list so as to preserve investor confidence.  Thursday's ruling by a district court in Perchesk overturned a previous decision in a lower court permitting the sale. The consortium which won the auction for the mill was created by Viktor Pinchuk son-in-law of former-President Leonid Kuchma and Rinat Akhmetov the country's richest man. The next step is for the supreme court to annul the sale altogether opening the way for Krivorizhstal to be resold. Mr Yushchenko has suggested a fair valuation could be as much as $3bn. One of the foreign bidders who lost out steel giant LNM told BBC News that it would be interested in any renewed sale. ";;;
1, Shares in Cairn Energy have jumped 6% after the firm said an Indian oilfield was larger than previously thought.  Cairn said drilling to the north-west of its development site in Rajasthan had produced ""very strong results"". The company also said it now believed the development area would be able to produce oil for more than 25 years. Cairn's share price rose 300% last year after a number of oil finds but its shares were hit in December following a disappointing drilling update. December's share fall means that Cairn is still in danger of being relegated from the FTSE 100 when the index is reshuffled next month. Cairn's shares closed up 64 pence or 6% at 1130p on Thursday.  Before Christmas Cairn revealed that drilling to the north of the field in Rajasthan had been disappointing which caused its shares to lose 18% in one day.  However on Thursday the group said its belief that the path of oil in the area actually moved further to the west had proved correct. ""This area does need more appraisal drilling but it looks very strong"" Dr Mike Watts head of exploration said. Chief executive Bill Gammell added: ""The more we progress in Rajasthan the better we feel about it."" Cairn made the discovery after having been granted an extension to their drilling licence in January by Indian authorities. The firm has applied for a 30-month extension to scout for oil outside its main development area which includes the Mangala and Aishwariya fields where Cairn has previously announced major discoveries. It also said production at its other fields across the globe was likely to surpass levels seen in 2004. ";;;
1, Georgia is offering a one-off 'tax amnesty' to people who hid their earnings under the regime of former president Eduard Shevardnadze.  The country's new president Mikhail Saakashvili has said that anyone now willing to disclose their wealth will only have to pay 1% in income tax. The measure is designed to legitimise previously hidden economic activity and boost Georgia's flagging economy. Georgia's black market is estimated to be twice the size of its legal economy.  Mr Saakashvili elected president in January after Mr Shevardnadze was toppled has urged the Georgian Parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible. It is one of a series of proposals designed to tackle corruption which was rampant during the Shevardnadze era and boost Georgia's fragile public finances.  The new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before 1 January three days before President Saakashvili was elected. ""There are people who have money but are afraid to show it"" the president told a government session. ""Documentation about where this money came from doesn't exist because under the former entirely warped regime earning capital honestly was not possible.""  By declaring their assets and paying the one-off tax people would be able to ""legalise their property"" Mr Saakashvili stressed.  ""No one will have the right to check this money's origin. This money must go back into the economy."" The amnesty will not extend to people who made money through drugs trafficking or international money laundering. Criminal investigations in such cases -thought to involve about 5% of Georgian businesses -are to continue. Mr Saakashvili has accused the Shevardnadze regime which was toppled by a popular uprising in November of allowing bribery to flourish. Georgia's economy is in a desperate condition. Half the population are living below the poverty line with many surviving on income of less than $4 or three euros a day. The unemployment rate is around 20% while the country has a $1.7bn public debt. ";;;
1, Fidel Castro's decision to ban all cash transactions in US dollars in Cuba has once more turned the spotlight on Cuba's ailing economy.  All conversions between the US dollar and Cuba's ""convertible"" peso will from 8 November be subject to a 10% tax. Cuban citizens who receive money from overseas and foreign visitors who change dollars in Cuba will be affected. Critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards reflecting the Cuban president's desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise. In a live television broadcast announcing the measure President Castro's chief aide said it was necessary because of the United States' increasing ""economic aggression"". ""The ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the US government to suffocate our country"" he said.  The Bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on Cuba in recent months. President Bush's government which has been a strong supporter of the 40-year-old trade embargo on Cuba introduced even tighter restrictions on Cuba in May.  Cubans living in the US are now limited to one visit to Cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives. A leading expert on the Cuban economy says that Castro's tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture. ""I think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash"" says Jose Barrionuevo head of strategy for Latin American emerging markets for Barclays Capital. ""It underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue.""  The tax will hit the families of Cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home. This money known as remittances can amount to as much as $1bn a year. Those remaining in Cuba will have to pay the tax. Their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax such as euros or increase their dollar payments to compensate. However many of Cuban's poorest citizens could be worse off as a result. The tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit Cuba every year particularly those Americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there.  Cuba's tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and according to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America is now worth $3bn to the country.  The tax is designed to provide much-needed revenue for Cuba's cash-strapped economy. Cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food fuel and medicine. Much of Cuba's basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. In recent weeks Cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in a decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island. Cuba's economy had staged a modest recovery during the mid 1990s as the collapse of the Soviet Union forced it to embrace foreign capital decentralise trade and permit limited private enterprise. However a decline in foreign tourism since 2002 periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put a strain on the economy. It has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the government's economic problems. The tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading Mr Barrionuevo said. ""The main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries like Venezuela which have restrictions on capital"" he says. Mr Barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity. ""It is intended to be a permanent measure but I am not sure it can last too long."" ";;;
1, Swiss drugmaker Novartis has announced 5.65bn euros ($7.4bn";" Â£3.9bn) of purchases to make its Sandoz unit the world's biggest generic drug producer.  Novartis which last month forecast record sales for 2005 said it had bought all of Germany's Hexal. It also acquired 67.7% of Hexal's US affiliate Eon Labs and offered to buy the remaining shares for $31 each. Novartis said that it would be able to make cost savings of about $200m a year following the acquisitions. Novartis' shares rose 1% to 57.85 Swiss francs in early trading.  The deal will see Novartis' Sandoz business overtake Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals as the world's biggest maker of generics. Based on 2004 figures the newly merged producer would have sales of more than $5bn the company estimated. Novartis said that it would merge a number of departments adding that there may be job cuts.  ""The strong growth outlook for Sandoz which will create jobs is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force"" the firm said in a statement. Generic drugs are chemically identical to their more expensive branded rivals. Producers such as Sandoz can copy the branded products usually after their patent protection expires and can sell them more cheaply as they do not have to pay research and development cost.  There are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that they call fragmented. However not all analysts were initially convinced about the deal. ""This is a very expensive acquisition"" Birgit Kuhlhoff from Sal Oppenheim investment bank told Reuters. ""I find it strange that they are making acquisitions in exactly those markets where they suffered price pressure."" ";;
1, A shareholder in US phone firm MCI has taken legal action to halt a $6.75bn (Â£3.6bn) buyout by telecoms giant Verizon hoping to get a better deal.  The lawsuit was filed on Friday after Qwest Communications which had an earlier offer for MCI rejected said it would submit an improved bid. MCI's directors have backed Verizon despite it tabling less money. They are accused of breaching their fiduciary duties by depriving MCI shareholders ""of maximum value"".  According the legal papers filed in a Delaware court Verizon is set to pay an """"unconscionable unfair and grossly inadequate"" sum for MCI which was formerly known as Worldcom. Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn. A number of large MCI shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision saying that Verizon's offer made up of cash shares and dividends undervalued the company. Friday's lawsuit argues that the Verizon offer makes no provision for future growth prospects and that consolidation in the US phone industry will put a premium on MCI's network assets and clients. MCI's directors have argued that Verizon is bigger than Qwest has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. Chief executive Michael Capellas spent last week meeting with shareholders in an effort to win their backing.  In 2002 investors in the then-named Worldcom lost millions when the company filed for bankruptcy following an accounting scandal. However the firm - now renamed MCI - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last April. It is a long-distance and corporate phone firm and would provide the buyer with access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. MCI shares jumped on Friday hitting their highest level since April 2004 amid speculation that it would be the focus of a bidding war. A takeover of MCI would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. Earlier this month SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone pioneer AT&T for about $16bn. ";;;
1, Deutsche Boerse investors unhappy with its London Stock Exchange bid will have no chance to throw out the exchange's management until May Reuters says.  The Sunday Times reported that hedge funds TCI and Atticus were planning to demand the removal of the group's chairman and chief executive. But Deutsche Boerse told news agency Reuters such a move would have to wait until May's annual general meeting. Investors want Deutsche to return cash to shareholders rather than bid. ""We are long-term investors and are experienced in removing management. We are not scared to take this to its conclusion this time"" Atticus' David Slager told the Sunday Times. However Deutsche Boerse told Reuters: ""TCI's request for the removal of the supervisory board will be considered at the annual general meeting on May 25.""  The Sunday Times reported that TCI had been drawing up a list of heavyweight executives to replace Deutsche's chairman Rolf Breuer and chief executive Werner Seifert. The group owns more than 5% of Deutsche - more than enough to demand an extraordinary general meeting to call on shareholders to oust the German exchange's management. Under German law Deutsche does not need investor backing to make a takeover bid. TCI and Atticus have opposed the LSE bid for some time saying it would destroy shareholder value and would be better spent on a share buyback. Deutsche is in competition with pan-European bourse Euronext to take over the London exchange. Many commentators have suggested a bidding war between the two could break out. However any such move would have to wait until March when the Office of Fair Trading completes an investigation into the competition aspects of the pair's takeover proposals. ";;;
1, President Bush is to send his toughest budget proposals to date to the US Congress seeking large cuts in domestic spending to lower the deficit.  About 150 federal programs could be cut or axed altogether as part of a $2.5 trillion (Â£1.3 trillion) package aimed at curbing the giant US budget deficit. Defence spending will rise however while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in Iraq. Vice-President Dick Cheney said the budget was the ""tightest"" so far.  At the heart of the administration's fifth budget presented to Congress on Monday is an austere package of domestic measures. These would see discretionary spending rise below the projected level of inflation.  Such belt-tightening is designed to tackle the massive budget deficit increases of President Bush's first term. Mr Cheney admitted that the budget was the toughest of the Bush Presidency but argued it was ""fair and responsible"". ""It is not something we have done with a meat axe nor are we suddenly turning our back on the most needy people in our society"" he said. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan increased expenditure on national security after 9/11 and the 2001 recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by President Bush in 2001 and turned it into a record deficit. The shortfall is projected to rise to $427bn in 2005.  Education environmental protection and transport initiatives are set to be scaled back as a first step towards reducing the deficit to $230bn by 2009.  Most controversially the government is seeking to cut the Medicaid budget which provides health care to the nation's poorest by $45bn and to reduce farm subsidies by $587m. Spending on defence and homeland security is set to increase although not by as much as originally planned. President Bush's proposals would see the Pentagon's budget rise by $19bn to $419.3bn while homeland security would get an extra $2bn.  The budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for which the administration in expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year.  Also not featuring in the proposals is the cost of funding the administration's radical proposed overhaul of social security provision. Some expects believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5bn trillion over a twenty year period. Despite the Republicans holding a majority in both houses of Congress the proposals will be fiercely contested over the next few months.  John McCain a Republican Senator said he was pleased the administration was prepared to tackle the deficit. ""With the deficits that we are now running I am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget"" he said. However Democratic Senator Kent Conrad said the proposals exposed the country to huge financial commitments beyond 2009. ""The cost of everything he [President Bush] advocates explodes"" he said.

1, A row over the colour orange could hit the courts after mobile phone giant Orange launched action against a new mobile venture from Easyjet's founder.  Orange said it was starting proceedings against the Easymobile service for trademark infringement. Easymobile uses Easygroup's orange branding. Founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou has pledged to contest the action. The move comes after the two sides failed to come to an agreement after six months of talks. Orange claims the new low-cost mobile service has infringed its rights regarding the use of the colour orange and could confuse customers - known as ""passing off"".  ""Our brand and the rights associated with it are extremely important to us"" Orange said in a statement. ""In the absence of any firm commitment from Easy we have been left with no choice but to start an action for trademark infringement and passing off."" However Mr Haji-Ioannou who plans to launch Easymobile next month vowed to fight back saying: ""We have nothing to be afraid of in this court case. ""It is our right to use our own corporate colour for which we have become famous during the last 10 years."" The Easyjet founder also said he planned to add a disclaimer to the Easygroup website to ensure customers are aware the Easymobile brand has no connection to Orange. The new service is the latest venture from Easygroup which includes a chain of internet cafes budget car rentals and an intercity bus service. Easymobile will allow customers to go online to order SIM cards and airtime - which will be rented from T-Mobile - for their existing handsets. ";;;
1, Standard Life Europe's largest mutual life insurer has cut bonuses for with-profit policyholders.  Annual bonus rates on its with-profits life policies were cut from 2.5% to 2% while bonuses on pension policies were reduced from 3.25% to 2.5%. It is the sixth time in three years Standard Life has made cuts to bonus rates despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004. The insurer blamed the cuts on poor share returns and low interest rates.  With-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. Profits made in good years are kept in reserve to pay investors an annual bonus even when the stock market performs badly. Slumping share prices throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. Standard Life came in for criticism for sticking with stock market investments during 2001 and 2002. The insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered. Recently Norwich Union and Axa Sun Life both cut their with-profit bonus rates.  John Gill managing director of the insurer's life and pensions division said that a strong stock market recovery in the past two years had only ""partly compensated for losses during 2001 and 2002"". In addition low interest rates meant that ""long-term investment returns are well below historic levels"" Mr Gill added. However Mr Gill maintained that with-profits continued to perform well over the long term. ""Our payouts continue to stand up well against other types of long-term investments over similar periods"" he said. Standard Life has an estimated 2.4 million with-profits policyholders. Last year the company announced that it was looking to float on the stock market in 2006. ";;;
1, Shares in music giant EMI have sunk by more than 16% after the firm issued a profit warning following disappointing sales and delays to two album releases.  EMI said music sales for the year to March will fall 8-9% from the year before with profits set to be 15% lower than analysts had expected. It blamed poor sales since Christmas and delays to the releases of new albums by Coldplay and Gorillaz. By 1200 GMT on Monday EMI shares were down 16.2% at 235.75 pence.  EMI said two major albums scheduled for release before the end of the financial year in March - one by Coldplay and one by Gorillaz - have now had their release dates put back.  ""EMI Music's sales particularly re-orders in January have also been lower than anticipated and this is expected to continue through February and March"" the company added. ""Therefore for the full year at constant currency EMI Music's sales are now expected to be 8% to 9% lower than the prior year."" The company said it expected profits to be about Â£138m ($259.8m). Alain Levy chairman and chief executive of EMI Music described the performance as ""disappointing"" but added that he remained optimistic over future trends in the industry. ""The physical music market is showing signs of stabilisation in many parts of the world and digital music in all its forms continues to develop at a rapid pace"" he said.  Commenting on the delay to the release of the Coldplay and Gorillaz albums Mr Levy said that ""creating and marketing music is not an exact science and cannot always coincide with our reporting periods"". ""While this rescheduling and recent softness is disappointing it does not change my views of the improving health of the global recorded music industry"" he added. Paul Richards an analyst at Numis Securities said the market would be focusing on the slump in music sales rather than the timing of the two albums. ""It's unusual to see this much of a downgrade just because of phasing"" he said. ";;;
1, Chinese online game operator Shanda Interactive Entertainment has bought a 20% stake in Sina the country's biggest internet portal firm.  The move may be a precursor to a full takeover with analysts saying that a better-known international firm may also now show an interest in Sina. Shanda said that it may boost its stake in Sina even buying it outright. A merger would create a firm that offers online role-playing games news entertainment and wireless messaging.  Sina said that the purchase of a stake by Shanda would have no impact on its business.  The board of directors said in a statement that it would ""continue to act in the best interests of all the company stakeholders including shareholders employees and customers"". Both companies are listed on the New York Stock Exchange's (NYSE) technology-dominated Nasdaq index. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission Sina said its shares were purchased between 12 January and 10 February for about $230m. Rumours about a possible takeover boosted Sina's shares by more than 10% on Friday. They added an extra 6.4% to $27.24 in electronic trading after the trading session had finished. And there may be more gains amid bid speculation when trading resumes in New York on Tuesday after Monday's public holiday analysts forecast. ""There could still be some potential parties that could still counter bid"" said Wallace Cheung an analyst at DBS Vickers. ""Even though Shanda has 20% of Sina they still have quite a long way to take full control."" However Mr Cheung noted that a foreign company trying to take control of a Chinese internet portal firm with its ability to filter and pass on news may not be viewed very favourably by Beijing. ";;;
1, Shares in Manchester United were up over 5% by noon on Monday following a new offer from Malcolm Glazer.  The board of Man Utd is expected to meet early this week to discuss the latest proposal from the US tycoon that values the club at Â£800m ($1.5bn). Manchester United revealed on Sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from Mr Glazer. A senior source at the club told the BBC: ""This time it's different"". The board is obliged to consider this deal. But the Man Utd supporters club urged the club to reject the new deal. Manchester United past and present footballers Eric Cantona and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and club manager Sir Alex Ferguson have lent their backing to the supporters' group Shareholders United. They have all spoken out against the bid.  A spokesman for the supporters club said: ""I can't see any difference (compared to Mr Glazer's previous proposals) other than Â£200m less debt. ""He isn't bringing any money into the club";" he'll use our money to buy it.""  Mr Glazer's latest move is being led by Mr Glazer's two sons Avi and Joel according to the Financial Times. A proposal was received by David Gill United's chief executive at the end of last week pitched at about 300p a share. David Cummings head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments said he believed a ""well funded"" 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club. ""I do not think there is anything that Manchester United fans can do about it"" he told the BBC. ""They can complain about it but it is curtains for them. They may not want him but they are going to get him."" The US tycoon who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months has approached the United board with ""detailed proposals"" it has confirmed.  Mr Glazer who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. He is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal though it is not clear by how much. For his proposal to succeed he needs the support of United's largest shareholders the Irish horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier. They own 29% of United through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle. Mr Glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%. But it is not yet known whether Mr McManus and Mr Magnier would support a Glazer bid. NM Rothschild the investment bank is advising Mr Glazer according to the Financial Times. His previous adviser JPMorgan quit last year when Mr Glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three United directors to the board against its advice. But the FT said it thought JP Morgan may still have had some role in financing Mr Glazer's latest financial proposal. ";;
1, The price of gold has fallen after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it will look at ways of using its gold reserves to provide debt relief.  By revaluing its holdings the IMF may be able to sell billions of dollars of gold and use the cash to cancel debts owed by the world's poorest nations. The plan was put forward by G7 finance ministers over the weekend. The price of gold fell to $413.50 an ounce in Asia before rebounding slightly in early European trading.  IMF boss Rodrigo Rato was asked by G7 ministers to carry out a study into the feasibility of revaluing and selling gold reserves.  He is expected to present his conclusions at an IMF meeting in Washington during April. ""Whatever happens the market is going to be disconcerted and on the back foot until the April IMF meetings"" said John Reade an analyst at UBS. The IMF values its gold reserves at between $40 and $50 an ounce a price that was fixed in the 1970s and is about a tenth of the metal's current market value. The IMF has 3217 tonnes of gold or about 113.5m ounces. Bringing the book price of the gold in line with market value would boost the IMF's balance sheet giving it more money to distribute.  This idea has been put forward before but there now seems to be a more committed political drive to address the issue of global poverty. ""This is the first time there has been a mention of the use of gold in a G7 communiqu&#233";" for achieving debt relief"" said UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. At their meeting in London G7 finance ministers backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts owed by some of the world's poorest countries. Mr Brown said the meeting would be remembered as ""the 100% debt relief summit"". While debt relief seems to have jumped to the top of the global agenda not everyone is convinced that selling IMF gold is the best way forward. The US which can veto any plan to sell IMF gold should it so choose said it is looking at other ways of solving the problem. ""The US is not convinced that's the necessary way to do it"" said Treasury Under Secretary John Taylor. Canada a key gold producer also expressed reservations. ";;
1, Consumer electronics giants Hitachi and Matshushita Electric are joining forces to share and develop technology for flat screen televisions.  The tie-up comes as the world's top producers are having to contend with falling prices and intense competition. The two Japanese companies will collaborate in research & development production marketing and licensing. They said the agreement would enable the two companies to expand the plasma display TV market globally.  Plasma display panels are used for large thin TVs which are replacing old-style televisions. The display market for high-definition televisions is split between models using plasma display panels and others - manufactured by the likes of Sony and Samsung - using liquid-crystal displays (LCDs). The deal will enable Hitachi and Matsushita which makes Panasonic brand products to develop new technology and improve their competitiveness. Hitachi recently announced a deal to buy plasma display technology from rival Fujitsu in an effort to strengthen its presence in the market.  Separately Fujitsu announced on Monday that it is quitting the LCD panel market by transferring its operations in the area to Japanese manufacturer Sharp. Sharp will inherit staff manufacturing facilities and intellectual property from Fujitsu. The plasma panel market has seen rapid consolidation in recent months as the price of consumer electronic goods and components has fallen. Samsung Electronics and Sony are among other companies working together to reduce costs and speed up new product development. ";;;
1, MG Rover's proposed tie-up with China's top carmaker has been delayed due to concerns by Chinese regulators according to the Financial Times.  The paper said Chinese officials had been irritated by Rover's disclosure of its talks with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp in October. The proposed deal was seen as crucial to safeguarding the future of Rover's Longbridge plant in the West Midlands. However there are growing fears that the deal could result in job losses. The Observer reported on Sunday that nearly half the workforce at Longbridge could be under threat if the deal goes ahead.  Shanghai Automotive's proposed Â£1bn investment in Rover is awaiting approval by its owner the Shanghai city government and by the National Development and Reform Commission which oversees foreign investment by Chinese firms. According to the FT the regulator has been annoyed by Rover's decision to talk publicly about the deal and the intense speculation which has ensued about what it will mean for Rover's future. As a result hopes that approval of the deal may be fast-tracked have disappeared the paper said. There has been continued speculation about the viability of Rover's Longbridge plant because of falling sales and unfashionable models.  According to the Observer 3000 jobs - out of a total workforce of 6500 - could be lost if the deal goes ahead. The paper said that Chinese officials believe cutbacks will be required to keep the MG Rover's costs in line with revenues. It also said that the production of new models through the joint venture would take at least eighteen months. Neither Rover nor Shanghai Automotive commented on the reports. ";;;
1, US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has given a speech at a Scottish church in honour of the pioneering economist Adam Smith.  He delivered the 14th Adam Smith Lecture in Kirkcaldy Fife. The Adam Smith Lecture celebrates the author of 1776's Wealth of Nations which became a bible of capitalism. Dr Greenspan was invited by Chancellor Gordon Brown whose minister father John used to preach at the St Bryce Kirk church. Mr Brown introduced Dr Greenspan to the 400 invited guests as the ""the world's greatest economist"". Dr Greenspan 79 who has been in the UK to attend the G7 meeting in London said the world could never repay the debt of gratitude it owed to Smith whose genius he compared to that of Mozart.  He said the philosopher was a ""towering contributor to the modern world"". ""Kirkcaldy the birthplace in 1723 of Adam Smith and by extension of modern economics is also of course where your chancellor was reared. ""I am led to ponder to what extent the chancellor's renowned economic and financial skills are the result of exposure to the subliminal intellect-enhancing emanation in this area."" He continued: ""Smith reached far beyond the insights of his predecessors to frame a global view of how market economics just then emerging worked. ""In so doing he supported changes in societal organisation that were to measurably enhance standards of living.""  Dr Greenspan said Smith's revolutionary philosophy on human self-interest laissez-faire economics and competition had been a force for good in the world. ""The incredible insights of a handful of intellectuals of the Enlightenment - especially with Smith toiling in the environs of Kirkcaldy - created the modern vision of people free to choose and to act according to their individual self-interest"" he said. Following his lecture Dr Greenspan - who received an honorary knighthood from the Queen at Balmoral in 2002 - was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He later opened an exhibition dedicated to Smith in the atrium of Fife College of Further and Higher Education. Joyce Johnston principal of the college said: ""It is very fitting that the world's premier economist delivered this lecture in tribute to the world's first economist."" Dr Greenspan - who became chairman of the Federal Reserve for an unprecedented fifth term in June 2004 - will step down in January next year. He has served under Presidents George W Bush Bill Clinton George Bush and Ronald Reagan. He was also chairman of the council of economic advisors to Gerald Ford. ";;;
1, UK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises according to a report.  Optimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending say researchers at BDO Stoy Hayward. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year. Rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in May. The BDO optimism index - a leading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead edged up in January to 102.5 from 102.2 in October. The rise is due in part to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity.  The only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election BDO said. Its BDO's output index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for January implying GDP growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. However the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises sterling's strength against the dollar and high oil prices the group noted. Its inflation index which has risen continuously over the last 8 months climbed to 110.0 in January from 108.0 in October last year. ""The UK is looking strong going into the general election but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary pressures"" said Peter Hemington partner at BDO Stoy Hayward. ""Growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services."" ";;;
1, The US stock market watchdog's chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new US corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms.  In a speech at the London School of Economics William Donaldson promised ""several initiatives"". European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly. The US regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  The Act comes into force in mid-2005. It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations which critics say will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.  Firms that break the new law could face huge fines while senior executives risk jail terms of up to 20 years. Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would ""continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements"". There are few if any who disagree with the intentions of the Act which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts. But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing. The Act also applies to firms with more than 300 US shareholders a situation many firms without US listings could find themselves in.  The 300-shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy a delisting. Mr Donaldson said the SEC would ""consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process"" for foreign firms unwilling to meet US requirements.  ""We should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections"" without turning the US market into ""one with no exit"" he said. He revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the Act's least popular measure - Section 404 - for foreign firms. Seen as particularly costly to implement Section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm's internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including US ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (Â£374m).  A delegation of European firms visited the SEC in December to press for change the Financial Times reported.  It was led by Digby Jones director general of the UK's Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and included representatives of BASF Siemens and Cadbury Schweppes. Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings. Air China picked the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (Â£558m) stock market debut last month. There are also rumours that two Chinese state-run banks - China Construction Bank and Bank of China - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in New York later this year. Instead the cost of Sarbanes-Oxley has persuaded them to stick to a single listing in Hong Kong according to press reports in China. ";;;
1, Nissan has named a lifetime employee to run its operations after Carlos Ghosn its highly successful boss takes charge at Renault.  As chief operating officer Toshiyuki Shiga will run Nissan on a daily basis although Mr Ghosn who masterminded its recovery will remain chief executive. Mr Ghosn is to become chairman and chief executive of Renault which owns 44% of the Japanese carmaker in April. Mr Ghosn transformed Nissan into a fast-growing and profitable business.  Mr Shiga will nominally serve as Mr Ghosn's deputy. However he will be Nissan's most senior Japan-based executive and will be in charge of the firm's global sales and marketing.  He is currently in charge of Nissan's operations across Asia and Australasia and is credited with significantly improving its sales in China. He will inherit a strong legacy from Mr Ghosn who has overseen a dramatic turnaround in Nissan's fortunes in the past five years. Dubbed 'le cost killer' for pushing through huge cost cuts in previous jobs Mr Ghosn reduced Nissan's overheads by 20% and trimmed its workforce by about 200000 after taking charge in 1999. These actions helped Nissan turn a 684bn yen ($6.4bn) loss in 2000 into a 331bn yen ($2.7bn) profit the following year. During his tenure Nissan has increased its market share and made significant strides in key export markets. Nissan aims to increase vehicle sales to more than four million by 2008 launching 28 new models in the process.  In his new job as Renault chief executive Mr Ghosn will devote 40% of his time to Renault 40% to Nissan and the rest to the group's activities in North America and other key markets.  Mr Ghosn said Mr Shiga's appointment would ensure a ""seamless"" transition in management. ""I need a leadership team capable of accelerating the performance and delivery of results that has characterized Nissan over the past six years"" Mr Ghosn said. ""I have full confidence in Toshiyuki Shiga and the new leadership team to help me implement the next chapter of Nissan's growth."" Nissan also announced a number of other management appointments with promotions for several younger executives. ";;;
1, Ukraine is to review ""dozens"" of state asset sales as the country's new administration tackles corruption.  The figure announced by President Viktor Yushchenko is less than the 3000 cases mentioned last week but will cover many of the biggest deals. Ukraine recently ousted long-serving leader Leonid Kuchma and has said it wants closer European Union links. In a separate statement the EU said that the US should back Ukraine's entry into the World Trade Organisation. The comments came as Viktor Yushchenko prepared to head to Brussels to meet with US President George W Bush and other North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) leaders. He is the only non-Nato member leader invited to attend the summit.  Mr Yushchenko recently defeated Moscow-backed presidential candidate and Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych at the polls and has made no secret of his wish to fight corruption and make Ukraine more transparent.  Earlier this month new Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said as many as 3000 firms may have their privatisations put under the spotlight. Her comments raised concerns among a number of investors and Mr Yushchenko was seen on Monday as trying to soothe their frayed nerves. ""We acknowledge that business in Ukraine is now shaped and 98% of privatisations were carried out according to the law"" Mr Yushchenko said on Monday. ""We have trust in this business and want to defend it by law"" he continued adding that any review would focus on ""dozens of companies not hundreds or thousands"". He cited last year's sale of Ukrainian steel producer Krivorizhstal as one that had raised concerns. It was sold in June 2004 to a consortium that included Viktor Pinchuk son-in-law of former-President Kuchma and Rinat Akhmetov the country's richest man for $800m (Â£424m) - despite other higher offers.  Vice-Prime Minister Oleg Rybachuk called on the EU to recognise the steps that Ukraine was taking fearing that should the country not be rewarded for its efforts there may be a backlash against closer relations with Brussels. He said that while he understood that Ukraine was not ready for EU membership the country needed to see progress on topics such as trade and visa requirements. ""We deserve an honest response"" Mr Rybachuk told the Associated Press in an interview. ""We understand the difficulties. We refuse to understand double standards."" Ukraine may find it has a sympathetic ear in Brussels ""The EU has reiterated that we support (Ukraine's) fast accession to the WTO and if possible we would like that to happen some time during the year"" said Claude Veron-Reville a spokesman for EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson. ""We have said as much to the Americans. We feel that it is important for us all to pull together for Ukraine to be allowed into the WTO. Mr Yushchenko was careful not to turn his back on Russia which borders the country to the east saying it was important to maintain 'pragmatic' ties with Moscow. ""Russia is Ukraine's eternal strategic partner"" Mr Yushchenko said. ";;;
1, South Africa biggest retail bank Absa has said it is still in talks with UK bank Barclays over the sale of majority stake in the group.  In November Absa said it was close to striking a deal with Barclays. But the group said Barclays is still waiting for the approval of South Africa's banking and competition authorities to make a formal offer. Absa also announced that it expects to see earnings grow by 20-25% in its current financial year.  ""Discussions with Barclays are continuing but shareholders are advised that no agreement has been reached as to any offer being made by Barclays to acquire a majority stake in Absa"" Absa said in a statement. If Barclays buys a stake in Absa it will be one of the largest foreign investments in South Africa in recent years. Absa currently has a market value of about $8.5bn (Â£4.4bn). Analysts said Absa's earnings forecast was better than expected. However the company warned that headline earnings growth would be trimmed by about four percentage points because of share options for a black economic empowerment transaction and a staff share incentive scheme. The South African group will release its results for the year to 31 March on 30 May. ";;;

The club which has posted record losses and racked up debts said last week that it was in ""a life-threatening profitability and financial situation"". Creditors agreed on Friday to suspend interest payments until 2007. News of the deal had boosted shares in the club on Friday but the stock slipped back 7% during Monday morning.  In addition to the interest-payment freeze Borussia Dortmund also will get short-term loans to help pay salaries. It estimated that it needs almost 30m euros ($39m"; Â£21m) until the end of June if it is to pay its bills. The football club is hoping that all its creditors will agree to defer rent payments on its Westfalen stadium. Borussia officials met with almost all the banks involved in its financing on Friday and over the weekend. Three creditors have yet to agree to the deal struck last week. On 14 March one of these creditors - property investment fund Molsiris which owns the club's stadium - holds its AGM at which it will discuss the rescue plan. Chief executive Gerd Niebaum stepped down last week and creditors have been pushing for a greater say in how the club is run. Borussia Dortmund also is facing calls to appoint executives from outside the club. The club posted a record loss of 68m euros in the 12 months through June. Adding to its woes Borussia Dortmund was beaten 5-0 by Bayern Munich on Saturday. ;;
1, Standard Life is the latest shareholder in Deutsche Boerse to express concern at the German stock market operator's plans to buy the London Stock Exchange.  It said Deutsche Boerse had to show why its planned Â£1.35bn ($2.5bn) offer for the LSE was good for shareholder value. Reports say Standard Life which owns a 1% stake in Deutsche Boerse may seek a shareholder vote on the issue. Fellow shareholders US-based hedge fund Atticus Capital and UK-based TCI Fund Management have also expressed doubts.  Deutsche Boerse's supervisory board has approved the possible takeover of the LSE despite the signs of opposition from investors. ""The onus is on Deutsche Boerse's management to demonstrate why the purchase of the LSE creates more value for shareholders than other strategies such as a buyback"" said Richard Moffat investment director of UK Equities at Standard Life Investments. Atticus Capital holding 2% of Deutsche Boerse wants it to buy back its own shares rather than buy the LSE. And TCI which holds about 5% has made a request for an extraordinary shareholders meeting to be held to vote on replacing the company's entire supervisory board. It has also demanded that shareholders be consulted about the proposed acquisition and whether the operator of the Frankfurt stock exchange should return $500m (Â£266m) to shareholders instead.  In December Deutsche Boerse which also owns the derivatives market Eurex and the clearing firm Clearstream put an informal offer of 530 pence per LSE share on the table. However the LSE said the cash offer ""undervalued"" both its own business and the benefits of such a tie-up. Since then an improved offer from Deutsche Boerse has been anticipated as its management has continued talks with LSE chief executive Clara Furse. But the London exchange is also holding talks with Deutsche Boerse's rival Euronext which operates the Amsterdam Brussels Lisbon and Paris exchanges as well as London-based international derivatives market Liffe.

1, Oil giant BP has announced a 26% rise in annual profits to $16.2bn (Â£8.7bn) on the back of record oil prices.  Last week rival Shell reported an annual profit of $17.5bn - a record profit for a UK-listed company. BP added that it was increasing its fourth-quarter dividend by 26% to 8.5 cents and that it would continue with share buybacks. BP chief executive Lord Browne said the results were strong ""both operationally and financially.""  The company is earning about $1.8m an hour.  Despite the record annual profits figure BP's performance was below the expectations of some City analysts. However BP's share price rose 4p or nearly 1% in morning trading to 548p. Its profit rise for the year included profits of $3.65bn (Â£1.97bn) for the final three months of 2004 - up from $2.89bn a year ago but below its third quarter.  Speaking on the BBC's Today programme on Tuesday Lord Browne said the profits were not solely down to the high oil price alone.  ""The profits are up more than the price of oil is up"" he said. Lord Browne pointed out that BP was reaping the benefits of its investment in oil exploration. ""We have spent many years buying (assets) when the price is low"" he said. The company has made new discoveries in Egypt the Gulf of Mexico and Angola.  However Lord Browne rejected calls for a windfall tax on his company's huge profits saying that in the North Sea it paid progressively more tax the more profits it made. Lord Browne believes oil prices will remain quite high. Currently above $40 a barrel he said: ""The price of oil will be well supported above $30 a barrel for the medium term."" BP put production for the year at 3.997 billion barrels of oil up 10% on 2003 but slightly lower than the four billion barrels it had initially aimed for. ";;;
1, International oil and mining companies have reacted cautiously to Russia's decision to bar foreign firms from natural resource tenders in 2005.  US oil giant Exxon said it did not plan to take part in a new tender on a project for which it had previously signed a preliminary agreement. Miner Highland Gold said it regretted any limit on privatisation while BP a big investor declined to comment. Only firms at least 51% Russian-owned will be permitted to bid.  The Federal Natural Resources Agency said ""the government is interested in letting Russian companies develop strategic resources"". The foreign ownership issue will be dealt with according to Russia's competition law natural resources minister Yuri Trutnev was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. No further details were given with Mr Trutnev suggesting that Russia may decide on a case-by-case basis. Observers said that the move may represent a shift in policy as the administration of Vladimir Putin puts the protection of national interests above free market dynamics. Russia recently wrested back control of a large chunk of its oil industry from stock-market listed company Yukos a move that prompted calls of outrage from many investors.  Analysts warned that it was still too early to draw too many conclusions from this new set of proposals.  Companies echoed this sentiment saying that they would require more information before ringing the alarm bells. ""It's not good. But it is very understandable"" said Al Breach an economist at UBS Brunswick. ""But if the investment climate is stable - that's much more important. ""Foreigners of course would like to have free entry but... this is not the end of the world."" A number of other nations including Mexico Saudi Arabia and Kuwait protect their national resources from foreign firms. What has surprised observers is that since the collapse of communism Russia has been courting foreign investment.  BP spent $7.5bn to create Russian-registered oil company TNK-BP and has a partnership to develop the Sakhalin 5 petroleum field with state-owned Rosneft. Exxon the world's largest oil company has signed preliminary agreements to develop the Sakhalin 3 field. Company spokesman Glenn Waller said Exxon still considered the deal valid despite Russia inviting new offers for the land block. According to Mr Waller Exxon ""were not planning to bid at a new tender anyway"". ""We regret the ministry has taken such a decision"" said Ivan Kulakov deputy chairman of Highland Gold - a mining firm that has the motto ""Bringing Russia's Gold to Market"". ""It would be a shame if that has a negative impact on the investment climate."" Other firms that have been linked with investment in Russia include France's Total the US-based ChevronTexaco and miner Barrick Gold. ";;;
1, Six UK greyhound tracks have been put up for sale by gaming group Wembley as part of a move which will lead to the break-up of the group.  Wembley announced the planned sale as it revealed it was to offload its US gaming division to BLB Investors. US gaming consortium BLB will pay $339m (Â£182.5m) for the US unit although the deal is subject to certain conditions. BLB holds a 22% stake in Wembley and last year came close to buying the whole firm in a Â£308m takeover deal. Shares in Wembley were up 56 pence or 7.6% at 797p by mid-morning.  The sale of the US gaming unit will leave Wembley with its UK business. This includes greyhound tracks at Wimbledon in London Belle Vue in Manchester Perry Barr and Hall Green in Birmingham Oxford and Portsmouth. Analysts have valued the six tracks at between Â£40m-Â£50m. The US business accounts for about 90% of Wembley's operating profit and consists of operations in Rhode Island and Colorado. BLB's purchase of the US unit is subject to the agreement of a revenue-sharing deal being struck with Rhode Island authorities. Wembley said that once the deal was completed it anticipated returning surplus cash to shareholders. ""Whilst the completion of the sale of the US Gaming Division remains subject to a number of conditions we believe this development is a positive step towards the maximisation of value for shareholders"" said Wembley chairman Claes Hultman. Wembley sold the English national football stadium in 1999 to concentrate on its gaming operations. ";;;
1, Manchester United's board has agreed to give US tycoon Malcolm Glazer access to its books.  Earlier this month Mr Glazer presented the board with detailed proposals on an offer to buy the football club. In a statement the club said it would allow Mr Glazer ""limited due diligence"" to give him the opportunity to take the proposal on to a formal bid. But it said it continued to oppose Mr Glazer's plans calling his assumptions ""aggressive"" and his plan ""damaging"". Many of Manchester United's supporters own shares in the club and the fan-based group Shareholders United is strongly opposed to any takeover by Mr Glazer. About 300 fans protested outside the Old Trafford ground two days ago.  Rival local club Manchester City has pleaded with visiting fans not to protest inside its ground when the two teams play a televised match on Sunday.  Manchester United's response comes as little surprise as the board made clear. ""Any board has a responsibility to consider a bona fide offer proposal"" the club said in its statement. Should it become a firm offer it should be at a price that ""the board is likely to regard as fair"" and on terms which ""may be deliverable"". But it also stressed that it stayed opposed to Mr Glazer's proposal. ""The board continues to believe that Mr Glazer's business plan assumptions are aggressive"" the statement said ""and the direct and indirect financial strain on the business could be damaging."" Whether or not the bid is attractive in monetary terms in the case of Manchester United many investors hold the stock for sentimental rather than financial reasons. At present Mr Glazer and his family hold a 28.1% stake making them Manchester United's second biggest shareholders. They own the successful Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team based in Florida. If the family makes a formal offer they will need the support of the club's biggest shareholders.  Irish horse racing millionaires JP McManus and John Magnier own 29% of United through their investment vehicle Cubic Expression and have yet to express a view on the bid approach.  A group of five MPs are calling on the Department of Trade and Industry to block any takeover of the club by the US football magnate on public interest grounds. They have signed a House of Commons motion and Tony Lloyd the Manchester Central MP whose constituency includes the club's Old Trafford ground has pledged to take the matter ""to Tony Blair if necessary"". The Commons motion says ""any takeover designed to transform the club into a private company would be against the interests of those supporters and football"". However the DTI has dismissed the proposal. A spokesman said the department did not believe there was a case for changing the Enterprise Act so that takeovers of football clubs could be looked at on non-competition grounds. Mr Glazer's offer values the club at Â£800m ($1.5bn). Pitched at 300p per share it also relies less on debt to finance it than an earlier approach from the US tycoon which was rejected out of hand. Manchester United shares closed at 270.25p on Friday down 3.75p on the day. ";;;
1, The January sales have failed to help the UK High Street recover from a poor Christmas season a survey has found.  Stores received a boost from bargain hunters but trading then reverted to December levels the British Retail Consortium and accountants KPMG said. Sales in what is traditionally a strong month rose by 0.5% on a like-for-like basis compared with a year earlier. Consumers remain cautious over buying big-ticket items like furniture said BRC director general Kevin Hawkins. Higher interest rates and uncertainty over the housing market continue to take their toll on the retail sector the BRC said. But clothing and footwear sales were said to be generally better than December while department stores also had a good month.  In the three-months to January like-for-like sales showed a growth rate of -0.1% the same as in the three months to December the BRC said. ""Following a relatively strong New Year's bank holiday trading then took a downward turn"" said Mr Hawkins. ""Even extending some promotions and discounts and the pay-day boost later in the month could not tempt customers."" The previous BRC survey found Christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years for retailers. And according to Office for National Statistics data sales in December failed to meet expectations and by some counts were the worst since 1981. ";;;
1, McDonald's the world's largest restaurant chain is to sponsor a programme on music channel MTV as part of its latest youth market promotion.  The show Advance Warning highlights new talent and MTV reckons it will give McDonald's access to nearly 400 million homes in 162 countries. McDonald's golden arches name and ""I'm loving it"" catchphrase will be used throughout the half-hour programme. The move comes amid growing concerns about obesity in Europe and the US.  The European Union has called on the food industry to reduce the number of adverts aimed at young children warning that legislation would be introduced. unless voluntary steps were taken. In the US food group Kraft is among firms that already have cut back on promoting sugar and fattening products to the young. McDonalds has also been taking steps to improve its junk food reputation revamping its menu and providing clients with health-related products such as pedometers. As well as burgers like the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder with Cheese the company now sells healthier options such as salads and fresh fruit. Chief executive Jim Skinner attributed an 8.3% increase in January worldwide sales to the ""vitality of our menu"" among other things.  Hooking up with MTV is expected to add extra momentum to McDonald's recent revival. MTV which played a key role in the emergence of the music video is to show Advance Warning on all 25 of its channels across the world. The programme can at present only been seen in the US where it has featured artists like British stars Joss Stone and Franz Ferdinand. McDonald's has targeted the youth market in the past with its advertisements signing up stars like jelly-legged dancer Justin Timberlake and all-woman singing group Destiny's Child. ";;;
1, The Trades Union Congress (TUC) is calling on the government to stem job losses in manufacturing firms by reviewing the help it gives companies.  The TUC said in its submission before the Budget that action is needed because of 105000 jobs lost from the sector over the last year. It calls for better pensions child care provision and decent wages. The 36-page submission also urges the government to examine support other European countries provide to industry. TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber called for ""a commitment to policies that will make a real difference to the lives of working people.""  ""Greater investment in childcare strategies and the people delivering that childcare will increases the options available to working parents"" he said. ""A commitment to our public services and manufacturing sector ensures that we can continue to compete on a global level and deliver the frontline services that this country needs."" He also called for ""practical measures"" to help pensioners especially women who he said ""are most likely to retire in poverty"". The submission also calls for decent wages and training for people working in the manufacturing sector. ";;;
1, Sri Lanka's banks face hard times following December's tsunami disaster officials have warned.  The Sri Lanka Banks Association said the waves which killed more than 30000 people also washed away huge amounts of property which was securing loans. According to its estimate as much as 13.6% of the loans made by private banks to clients in the disaster zone has been written off or damaged. State-owned lenders may be even worse hit it said.  The association estimates that the private banking sector has 25bn rupees ($250m";" Â£135m) of loans outstanding in the disaster zone. On one hand banks are dealing with the death of their customers along with damaged or destroyed collateral. On the other most are extending cheap loans for rebuilding and recovery as well as giving their clients more time to repay existing borrowing. The combination means a revenue shortfall during 2005 SLBA chairman - and Commercial Bank managing director - AL Gooneratne told a news conference. ""Most banks have given moratoriums and will not be collecting interest at least in this quarter"" he said. In the public sector more than one in ten of the state-owned People's Bank's customers in the south of Sri Lanka were affected a bank spokesman told Reuters. He estimated the bank's loss at 3bn rupees. ";;
1, Shares in Manchester United closed up 4.75% on Monday following a new offer from US tycoon Malcolm Glazer.  The board of the football club is expected to meet early this week to discuss the latest proposal which values the club at Â£800m ($1.5bn). Manchester United revealed on Sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from Mr Glazer which looks set to receive more serious scrutiny. The club has previously rejected Mr Glazer's approaches out of hand. But a senior source at the club told the BBC: ""This time it's different."" Supporters' group Shareholders United however urged the club to reject the new deal.  A spokesman for the Shareholders United said: ""I can't see any difference (compared to Mr Glazer's previous proposals) other than Â£200m less debt. ""He isn't bringing any money into the club";" he'll use our money to buy it.""  Mr Glazer's latest move is being led by Mr Glazer's two sons Avi and Joel according to the Financial Times. A proposal was received by David Gill United's chief executive at the end of last week pitched at about 300p a share. David Cummings head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments said he believed a ""well funded"" 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club.  ""I do not think there is anything that Manchester United fans can do about it"" he told the BBC. ""They can complain about it but it is curtains for them. They may not want him but they are going to get him."" The US tycoon who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months has approached the United board with ""detailed proposals"" it has confirmed.  Mr Glazer who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. He is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal though it is not clear by how much. For his proposal to succeed he needs the support of United's largest shareholders the Irish horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier. They own 29% of United through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle. Mr Glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%. But it is not yet known whether Mr McManus and Mr Magnier would support a Glazer bid. NM Rothschild the investment bank is advising Mr Glazer according to the Financial Times. His previous adviser JPMorgan quit last year when Mr Glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three United directors to the board against its advice. But the FT said it thought JP Morgan may still have had some role in financing Mr Glazer's latest financial proposal. ";;
